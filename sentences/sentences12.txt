Did Tom say anything about what happened?
Whatever you do, don't let Tom help you.
Tom said he didn't feel pain right away.
Tom is probably the person who did this.

That probably doesn't taste too bad.
I was surprised that Tom didn't win.
I don't think Tom would like Boston.
I don't really want to go to Boston.
I don't have the courage to do that.
Doing that would be a waste of time.
Do you want to go to Boston with me?
Do you know what Tom's last name is?
We don't have the means to do that.
We're already planning to do that.
Tom's reply didn't surprise anyone.
Tom doesn't have a fishing license.
That was the patriotic thing to do.
Should we really be doing this now?
It took courage to do what Tom did.
I've done nothing to be ashamed of.
I probably would do the same thing.
I don't really want to go swimming.
I don't like your patronizing tone.
Everyone can do better if they try.
Does anyone else have a suggestion?

Apparently, Tom did the same thing.

We must stop Tom from doing that.
We got nothing done this morning.
We didn't go to Boston last year.

They let me do whatever I wanted.
There are better ways to do that.
It's a pain that doesn't go away.
I'm capable of doing that myself.
I just wish Tom would do his job.
I just don't know where to start.

Regrettably, that didn't happen.
Maybe Tom has already done that.
It's time to get some work done.
It's actually very simple to do.
I just don't know what to think.
I hope I don't let anybody down.
I don't mind if you use my desk.
I don't like the way Tom drives.

Do you still play the saxophone?
Did you put my name on the list?

An old woman described the world as resting on a turtle, and then explained that the turtle was supported by another turtle, and finally when pushed with questions said it was "turtles all the way down."
Others hold that the earth has nine corners by which the heavens are supported.

When asked who would fix the body of the tortoise, so that it would not collapse, he said that he did not know.
It's turtles all the way down.

The King of Sweden, to whom this part of the country belonged, more than once gave orders to cut down the haunted wood, but there was no one with courage enough to obey his commands.

A few miles from the Tontlawald was a large village, where dwelt a peasant who had recently married a young wife.
The two quarrelled and fought all day long.
By his first wife the peasant had a daughter called Elsa, a good quiet girl, who only wanted to live in peace, but this her stepmother would not allow. She beat and cuffed the poor child from morning till night.
One day she went out with the other village children to pluck strawberries.
These stories are as old as anything that men have invented. They were narrated by naked savage women to naked savage children. They have been inherited by our earliest civilised ancestors, who really believed that beasts and trees and stones can talk if they choose, and behave kindly or unkindly. The stories are full of the oldest ideas of ages when science did not exist, and magic took the place of science.
When the nobles and other people became rich and educated, they forgot the old stories, but the country people did not, and handed them down.
But who really invented the stories nobody knows; it is all so long ago, long before reading and writing were invented. The first of the stories actually written down, were written in Egyptian hieroglyphs, or on Babylonian cakes of clay, three or four thousand years before our time.
"After all, what does it matter?" thought she. "The dwellers in the Tontlawald cannot be worse than my stepmother."
Stay here with me and be my friend, and we will play delightful games together, and every day we will go and gather strawberries.
"Come, let us go to my mother", and taking Elsa's hand she led her deeper into the wood, the little black dog jumping up beside them and barking with pleasure.
Oh! what wonders and splendours unfolded themselves before Elsa's astonished eyes! She thought she really must be in Heaven.
The waitress put a white tablecloth on the table.
The birds were not shy, but let the girls take them in their hands, and stroke their gold and silver feathers.
I found her alone in the wood, and brought her back with me for a companion. You will let her stay?
"The sea?" asked Elsa, staring; "what is that? I've never heard of such a thing!"
Children, it's time for you to come home!
I think it's time for you to come back home.
Everyone's in position.
"Do you see this girl?" said the lady of the house, pointing to Elsa. "I wish to adopt her for my daughter. Make me a copy of her, which we can send to her native village instead of herself."
All will go well as long as you are a good, obedient child, and I will take care of you and see that you want for nothing till you are grown up and can look after yourself.
"Now," he said to the lady, "all we want is a drop of the maiden's blood."
When she heard this Elsa grew white with horror, for she thought she was selling her soul to the evil one.
She took a tiny golden needle, pricked Elsa in the arm, and gave the needle to the old man, who stuck it into the heart of the doll.
When Elsa awoke the next morning in her silken bed, with its soft white pillows, she saw a beautiful dress lying over the back of a chair, ready for her to put on.
A maid came in to comb out her long hair, and brought the finest linen for her use.
Nothing gave Elsa so much joy as the little pair of embroidered shoes that she held in her hand, for the girl had hitherto been forced to run about barefoot by her cruel stepmother.
From this moment Elsa's life was that of the ordinary happy child.
She had no cares or troubles of any sort, and every day her tasks became easier, and the years that had gone before seemed more and more like a bad dream.
The world would be a great deal better if men, in their greed, did not seek to snatch every thing for themselves, instead of leaving something as a thankoffering to the giver of the blessings.
The years passed like the wind for Elsa, and she grew into a lovely woman, with a knowledge of many things that she would never have learned in her native village.
Elsa was anxious to learn all she could, but Kisika much preferred childish games to anything else.
The time has come when we must part.
"Ah, be quiet, child," replied the lady.
Now you are a woman, and I have no right to keep you here. You must return to the world of men, where joy awaits you.
I want no other happiness but to live and die beside you.
Make me your waiting maid, or set me to any work you choose, but do not cast me forth into the world.
"Do not talk like that, dear child," replied the lady.
You are only a common mortal, who will have to die one day, and you cannot stay here any longer.
Though we have the bodies of men, we are not men at all, though it is not easy for you to understand why.
Some day or other you will find a husband who has been made expressly for you, and will live happily with him till death separates you.
Then she drew her golden comb gently through Elsa's hair, and bade her go to bed.
Life seemed to stretch before her like a dark starless night.
It is a well-known fact that a bad woman seldom becomes better as she grows older, and Elsa's stepmother was no exception to the rule.
It is a well-known fact that a bad woman seldom becomes better as she grows older.
One day the stepmother had given the girl a frightful beating, and then threatened to kill her outright.
At night, when the husband came home, he found his wife lying dead upon the ground, her body all swollen and disfigured, but the girl was nowhere to be seen.
His screams brought the neighbours from their cottages, but they were unable to explain how it had all come about. It was true, they said, that about mid-day they had heard a great noise, but as that was a matter of daily occurrence they did not think much of it.
On the table he saw a slice of bread lying, and, being hungry, he ate it before going to sleep.
In the morning he too was found dead.
The girl tried to speak, but before she could sob out her thanks the old man had touched her softly on the head three times with his silver staff. In an instant Elsa knew that she was turning into a bird: wings sprang from beneath her arms; her feet were the feet of eagles, with long claws; her nose curved itself into a sharp beak, and feathers covered her body. Then she soared high in the air, and floated up towards the clouds, as if she had really been hatched an eagle.
For several days she flew steadily south, resting from time to time when her wings grew tired.
Suddenly a sharp pain quivered through her body, and she fell to the ground, pierced by an arrow.
As she was wondering what she should do next the king's son came riding by, and, seeing Elsa, sprang from his horse, and took her by the hand.
Every night, for half a year, have I dreamed, dear lady, that I should one day find you in this wood.
Then the prince took Elsa on his horse, and rode with her to the town, where the old king received her graciously.
A few days later the wedding took place.
After the king's death Elsa became queen.
That looks like blood.

He was a very hard-hearted man, for he could not bear poor people, and if he caught sight of a beggar anywhere near his house, he would order the servants to drive him away, or would set the dogs at him.
It was an act of desperation.
The tide has turned.
I know how much she meant to you.
Is there something wrong with your hearing?
Call it a Catch-22, but sometimes, you just can't realistically come out on top.
I think glimmering rain is so pretty; don't you?
So how would you define such a contribution? Does it really need to meet your expectations?
If I kept your secret, would you tell me the truth?
What do you mean I have too much personality?
I don't want to be alone anymore.
'Yesterday,' said the priest, 'a boy was born in the poorest house in the village. I named the unlucky little thing "Vassili."
The boy lived on with the monks, and grew up to be a clever, gentle, and handsome young man.
Mark wrote a letter to his wife and gave it to Vassili to take to her, and this was what was in the letter: 'When the bearer of this arrives, take him into the soap factory, and when you pass near the great boiler, push him in. If you don't obey my orders I shall be very angry, for this young man is a bad fellow who is sure to ruin us all if he lives.'
They dressed Vassili in fine clothes and next day he was married to Anastasia.
What are the differences between African and Asian elephants?
How dare you marry my daughter without my consent?
I want you to go for me to my friend the Serpent King, in his beautiful country at the world's end. Twelve years ago he built a castle on some land of mine. I want you to ask for the rent for those twelve years and also to find out from him what has become of my twelve ships which sailed for his country three years ago.
Vassili dared not disobey. He said good-bye to his young wife, who cried bitterly at parting, hung a bag of biscuits over his shoulders, and set out.
I'd like you to go to the supermarket and buy some bread.
Oh, Vassili, what brings you to this accursed place?
He thanked her very politely, and hurried off.
Vassili led a good and happy life with his dear wife, and his kind mother-in-law lived with them. He helped the poor and fed and clothed the hungry and naked and all Mark's riches became his.
It was the custom in old times that as soon as a Japanese boy reached manhood he should leave his home and roam through the land in search of adventures.
Don't pat me on the head like I'm still a child!
He dared not approach her.
He dared not speak to her.
Tom married the merchant's daughter.
How dare you marry my daughter without my consent!
Tom will never obtain my consent to marry my daughter.
Tom asked his girlfriend's father for permission to marry his daughter.
A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old, and had lost all his teeth.
This fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again.
They say ordinary can be extraordinary if you dig deep enough.
I don't make excuses. I only provide reasons.
Adopting a sentence on Tatoeba is a lot less of a commitment than adopting a child.
Tom is a karate expert.
Your outfit screams disaster.
I need you to relay some information for me.
Tom married Mary without her parents' consent.
It's a new take on an old game!
After a life-or-death experience, some people claim that they have found new takes on life.
Tom and Mary got married without their parents' consent.
It's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye!
Wouldn't it be amazing to create the world's largest dictionary?
I'm big on semantics; I always want to try to understand as much nuance as possible!
I'm heading to bed now. I can barely keep my eyes open.
That would be a shining example of sarcasm! It's sarcasm at its finest! Of course, I'm also being sarcastic.
Good night and sleep tight!
What am I?
My heart has been destroyed.
OK, I'll buy a car tomorrow!
What if I don't buy that car?
They won't help us...
I'm going to buy a dog tomorrow.
Oh, fine! I'll give it one more go! But that's it!
Is Gibraltar a country?
Guys, we need to talk.
Do not come back, OK?
Yes, it's over there.
I can't do it, sorry.
Is he a magician?
My mother is Greek.
Tom is always acting like he's better than everyone else.
Mary is always acting like she's better than everyone else.
She's not even really pretty.
If you don't sleep, you'll die.
C'mon, let's eat something!
Don't work too much, OK?
I will visit my grandmother's house.
She's Mary's sister-in-law.
I miss her every day.
It would be a lie if I say that I miss her.
I really like to watch Power Rangers!
Everybody likes French fries.
I'm pretty sure that everybody likes French fries.
Are online communities really so different from real-life communities?
Be careful with that heavy thing! Take it slowly now. That's right, easy does it.
As I slid across the wet pavement, my head ricocheted off the curb.
He liked to skip rocks in the early morning and watch them ricochet across the smooth surface of the pond.
We should've brought another bottle of wine.
The doctor wants Tom to lose a little weight.
I asked Tom if we could meet.
How dared you marry my daughter without my consent?
My closet is full of things that I never wear.
Croatian Ivo Karlovic, currently the tallest professional tennis player in the world, is known for his extremely powerful serve, and many tennis analysts, as well as fellow players, recognise him as the best server on the ATP tour. Aged 36, he is also the oldest top 100 player, as of 2015.
We enjoyed ourselves to the maximum!
I'm nothing more than myself.
Holy mackerel! Is that a shark?
On tennis forums, those who blindly support their favourite player while looking down on his or her opponents are commonly given the derogatory nickname "tards". Of course, a lot of times these same people use the word to refer to anyone supporting the players they don't like.
"Hahaha! We're going to make it rain, boys! By this time next week, we'll be swimming in cash!"
It's music to my ears.
With one swift kick, the door busted down!
She sped along at a breakneck pace!
Find a penny, pick it up, then all day you'll have good luck!
Tom, will you get up?
Tom was abducted by aliens.
Smile, you're on candid camera!
Mastering a language is much easier said than done.
Are you sure you can handle the responsibility? There's lots of work involved.
I'm going to take a break now. I feel a little burnt out.
She's been working her butt off for the last 50 years! Of course, she feels burnt out!
Do you ever see yourself as part of a bigger picture?
A feast like this is fit for a king!
I heard Mary crying in her room, so I went to check on her to see if she was OK.
"Fernando, we're racing Massa behind until the end." "Ha! I love your sense of humour." "Well, we can have some fun trying, anyway."
You have a very strange way of thinking.
This tree is approximately three hundred years old.
This tree is about 300 years old.

This website is full of shady advertisements and clickbait!
After falling victim to clickbait, my computer caught a virus.
The king longed to go out into the world, to try his strength in battle against some enemy and to win all kinds of honour and glory.
She cut off all her beautiful long brown hair and dressed herself in boy's clothes.
She took her lute and, without saying anything to anyone, she went forth into the wide world.
Taking her lute in her hand, she began to play so beautifully that one felt as though one could never hear enough.
Her voice was sweeter than the lark's.
'Welcome, O lute player,' said he. 'Where do you come from?'
So the lute player stayed on in the palace and sang and played almost all day long to the king, who could never tire of listening and almost forgot to eat or drink or to torment people.
'Well,' said the king, 'what do you desire as your reward?'
Video sites like YouTube are chock-full of clickbait titles such as "FATHER MARRIES DAUGHTER!?" or "MOST TERRIFYING GAME EVER!?".
I am no common prisoner, but the king of this country. Let me go free and ask what you will as your reward.
The queen took a short way home, got there before the king and changed her dress.
Our king has come back! Our king has returned to us.
And as she spoke she threw off her long cloak and everyone saw it was the queen.
I shan't forget that feast as long as I live.
Once upon a time the king of the Goldland lost himself in a forest, and try as he would he could not find the way out.
Mary is confident and independent.
Everyone gossips.
Make it pretty.
You shouldn't talk about your friends behind their backs.
Stop gossiping.
Tom's hands were shaking and his face was red.
Mary used to be a model.
Mary kept on flirting with him.
The government has declared three days of national mourning. Flags across the country have been lowered to half-mast.
What the fuck did he just do?!
Get out of here, now!
Are they real or fake?
Are the pearls real or fake?
Are her boobs real or fake?
Is this diamond real or fake?
It's easy to look at the world through rose-colored glasses.
It's not all sunshine and rainbows.
Of course, I'm serious! Is it not written on my face?
This city has many historical buildings.
She's an airhead.
Tom and Mary haven't decided yet whether they'll have children.
At your age, you try to act like a young man.
"Tom, I'm shot real bad. I can't carry on much longer if the bleeding doesn't stop."
'What are you doing here, friend?' asked the stranger; 'darkness is falling fast, and soon the wild beasts will come from their lairs to seek for food.'
The king exchanged his baby, a beautiful boy, for the daughter of a peasant, and the prince lived roughly as the son of poor people, while the little girl slept in a golden cradle, under silken sheets.
To become king at the cost of a maiden's life was too heavy a price to pay.
They came to a large stone, and here the old fellow stopped, looked carefully round, gave a sharp whistle, and stamped three times on the ground with his left foot. Suddenly there appeared under the stone a secret door, which led to what looked like the mouth of a cave.
The old fellow seized the youth by the arm, and said roughly, 'Follow me!'
Never speak unless you are spoken to.
Don't speak unless you are spoken to.
When the prince stepped over the threshold he caught sight of a maiden of wonderful beauty, with brown eyes and fair curly hair.
Then she took out a needle and thread, and began to darn her stockings.
His appetite was tremendous: he soon cleared all the dishes, and ate enough to satisfy a dozen men.
During the meal he stole many glances at the maiden, and would even have spoken to her, but she gave him no encouragement.
Every time he opened his mouth she looked at him sternly, as if to say, 'Silence,' so he could only let his eyes speak for him.
You can be a real nuisance when you want to.
She stood on tip-toe and whispered something in his ear, and then went away.
"Do not weep, child. I am only going away for a little while."
The prince loitered about all day.
Take an axe, and cut off the head of the calf with one blow. With a second, split its head in two, and in its brain you will see a bright red ball. Bring that to me.
Are you off for your date?
With one blow of the axe, he killed the calf, and with the second split its brain.
We must lose no time in escaping.
The old man slept very late that morning.
Listen to me, my ball, my ball. Be quick and change me into a brook, and my lover into a little fish.
I wouldn't dream of preventing you from watching the match!
All the sugar fell on the ground.
Now that you're eighteen, you should know better.
That book is new.
'Now we are safe,' cried she. 'Here the old wizard has no more power over us, and we can guard ourselves from his spells.'
He was absent from school today, as he often is.
I will never part from you. You must come with me and be my wife. We have gone through many troubles together, and now we will share our joys.
What a horrible dream!
How bad do I look?
Will you pay?
The food at this camp is terrible.
Tom asked me what I want.
They approached each other.
We're all going to be eaten by a monstrous talking shrubbery.
My cell phone is easy to use.
That cake was delicious.
Our opinions are quite different.
The children were particularly quiet.
Could you dust the table?
You're not that scary.
Once upon a time there lived a queen whose heart was sore because she had no children.
Let me see your hand, that I may read the future.
The queen held out her hand, and the old woman examined its lines closely.
The young king let it be known that he intended to marry, and commanded all the maidens in the kingdom to come to a feast, so that he might choose a wife from among them.
Imagine an entire world consisting only of metaphor. It wouldn't make sense.
Once upon a time an old man and his wife lived together in a little village.
"Tom pulled off another one of his big heists! What did he do? For crying out loud, he robbed a goddamn bank!"
That's worth a lot to me.
He did nothing bad.
We headed due north.
I don't like people who stare at me.
Let's go out on the balcony.
Not all of the museum's items are on display.
This vase is very fragile.
I wouldn't miss it for anything.
I wouldn't miss your wedding for anything.
I wouldn't miss your party for anything.
I wouldn't miss your concert for anything.
Are you free tomorrow night?
He is nearly 40.
Due to the lack of students, the school will be closed at the end of the year.
Could you please confirm the price for this?
Please note that the price is subject to change.
Could you please confirm the price by email?
Could you please confirm the price by fax?
Everyone in our class passed the exam.
I've been driving this car for three years.
I bought this car three years ago.

I can't do it, bro. I'm really sorry.
Mister Gipuzkoa won the title of Mister Spain in 1999.
Zaragoza in Aragon, Spain is a sister city of Zamboanga City.
I'm not confident that I can translate this book.
A French language edition of this novel has also been published.
They'll no doubt be searching for us.
He's at the next corner.
I lost my umbrella somewhere in the park so I need to buy a new one.
He came home fairly late last night.
Cutting in line is a big pet peeve of mine. Folks should have to wait their turn!
The key to the so-called mastery of any language is bringing the words and grammar to life through context.
He once mentioned a long time ago that he had boundaries that I could never cross. Now that we're apart, I realize what he said was largely a warning in disguise.
Please keep in mind that I'm not just a faceless entity behind a screen! I'm a person too no matter the mode I communicate from.
The association between trolls and bridges has a long history which marches on to this day in English pop culture.
I love the feeling I get when the wind rustles between the trees and tenderly stirs all around me.
She mounted the horse with ease.
The world is a place of seemingly infinite complexity.
I don't take kindly to pushiness or impatience.
I don't ever try to be sloppy. But I have to admit, I'm notorious for making unintentional typos.
I'm telling you for certain! That man's the worst of the worst! As he's the cream of the crime crop, you shouldn't be surprised that he's notorious for murder and unlawful subjugation.
I envied John. He not only attracted the unadulterated attention of every lady within his immediate vicinity, his educational performance was world-renowned as the cream of the crop.
You're going to have to work harder to capture even an ounce of my attention. Capturing my affection is just out of the question!
Phooey. I'm late again.
I'm not following you at all. Can you break it down for me?
He was truly a renowned professor who took the time to break every problem down step-by-step. Even a poor student like myself was able to follow along with and grasp such complex equations.
Hopefully, being ridiculous doesn't kill you !
The girls were sitting right next to each other.
I remember when my old grandpap used to sit out on the porch lightly strumming his guitar.
Paranoia is a serious disease, Tom. You should see a doctor.
Hey Tom, will you get out of the bed, or what?
She was an actress.
I don't know how they found out.
I don't know how Tom found out.
I don't know how she found out.
These rich girls are very superficial.
Don't make a show of yourself.
Mary was very candid in her interview.
Let this little book be thy friend, if, owing to fortune or through thine own fault, thou canst not find a dearer companion.
Primely skilled in the art of social manipulation and a rat at heart, he always convinced others to do his dirty underhanded work.
If you butter him up just like so, he'll give you everything and more than you could ever ask for.
I finished that end-of-term essay all in a night's work!
She gently chided at him for drinking all of the milk to his utter embarrassment.
You know what actresses are like.
The Euro is more than a currency.
Germany is a free country.
Germany is not ruled by the law of the jungle, but by the rule of law.
It's already been taken care of.
They don't want to live together.
Don't you have anything better to do other than annoy the crap out of me? Seriously, go jump in a lake!
I don't have to get up until 1 o'clock tomorrow.
I've come to the unfortunate conclusion that musicals simply annoy the crap out of me.
To attract sharks, scientists prepare a special bloody bait concoction known as "chum".
If triangles had a god, he would have three sides.
I had an old wire bird feeder that I used to fill often with a square slab of suet.
Apparently, it was his jealous mistress who prepared that nasty chemical concoction. I hear the wife took one sip of her morning coffee and collapsed without so much as a word.
I'm opening the door.
Let's continue from where we left off.
I don't think he has any friends.
As funny as the whole concept of a knuckle sandwich is, I wouldn't ever want to be on the receiving end.
If you keep pestering me, I'll send you overboard to chum the water with your useless guts!
The judge was forced to slam her gavel down multiple times in order to restore order to the court.
Have you heard the rumor about the new transfer student?
I don't like seeming pessimistic, but John's a total basket case. He's not just useless either. He's lost his mind!
Tom received a text message.
Mary sends about 100 text messages a day.
Tom sent Mary a text message.
"Zip it Tom! I've had enough of your excuses!"
Zip it! Lock it! And put it in your pocket! In other words, please just shut up already!
We started making out.
This is a waste of taxpayers' money.
In a brief moment of genius, I discovered the cure to aging!
I just had a flash of genius! We need to round up a crew!
Do I want to take that shiny new car off your hands? You betcha!
I can't believe we got invited!
I want to go on an adventure.
I don't want to go on an adventure. I want to watch TV.
"Yeppers! You heard me right the first time!"
If you want to go an adventure, you need to learn how to react quickly.
I'd love to go on an adventure with you.
I'd love to go to Boston with you.
I will work hard.
If you want to go on an adventure, you need to have quick reflexes.
I'll work hard.
Tom doesn't like to be made to wait.
He's trying hard.
It can be very hard to tell the difference between crazy people and misunderstood people. But of course, everything is all just a matter of opinion with varying degrees of evidence or no evidence at all.
So how do you propose we rectify the situation at hand?
They moved in the same circles.
If I were to spend more time strictly studying only for myself whilst minimizing red herrings online, I'd be more of the person I want to be.
This was Tom's first time being a part of a large community-based project. Though he felt nervous at first to be involved, the other members soon proved to be a very supportive bunch.
Stress can be a real vicious cycle. The greater the amount of stress, the harder it is to make smart logical decisions for yourself which only leads to more stress.
I'm so doggone exhausted, I can't even think straight.
Mary was so hungry, she gobbled up the pie in merely a few bites!
I sincerely hope that occasional sleep deprivation doesn't cause permanent damage to my brain.
Every person has the power to abuse their privileges.
They follow the masses and structure their lives mainly to please the perception of others. They're sheeple. Every last one of them.
I may be imagining it, but something smells weird.
No system can ever reach total consistency. In theory and on paper, things work. But in practice, they're messy. There's no way of getting around the butterfly effect.
It's hard to get to the punchline of a joke when you're laughing so hard that you can barely breathe!
I'll show you who's in charge!
There are some very common grammar mistakes that even an educated man might make if he isn't paying close enough attention.
"Please forgive my intrusion, but this is something that you're going to want to hear."
Could a logical conlang such as Lojban ever grow to rival the current popularity of Esperanto?
I've just been robbed.
"Now, I want you to speak very slowly and very clearly. Can you do that for me?" "I guess so."
I'm afraid I can't settle on an agreement if you can't meet these demands.
Is it that you're afraid of dying? Or is it a fear of flying? Perhaps, you are afraid of simply trying.
I'll be awake the whole night.
I am not a professional.
"Yippee! We're going on an adventure!" shouted little Timothy.
With such little benefit gained, this is a habit it would be best for me to curb. I could be doing more productive things with my precious time.
You may disagree with and venture to question me, but remember, the feeling's mutual.
The feeling's mutual.
No, I just can't remember. The answer completely eludes me.
It's time to put my thinking cap on and get to the bottom of this elusive mystery.
I'm a jack of all trades, a real triple threat. They'll try to stop me, but I'll be rising up the ranks in no time.
I'm the fastest reader you've ever seen! I'll be finished with this book in no time flat!
To me, computer programming is an interesting endeavor.
They hate me 'cause they ain't me!
I find that it's best to find a happy balance between originality and sticking to a strict standard.
You're going to have to do better to convince me of that.
I have my limits. If you cross them, I'll gladly walk away.
That is not how you talk to your superiors!
We're probably going to clash a lot as we're both heavily opinionated people. However, if we can both respect each other, things should blow over smoothly. They could possibly turn out quite nicely even.
Oftentimes, the best solution is to systematically attack the problem!
Arguing never got anyone anywhere.
People often confuse the difference between an argument and a debate.
Those terms are generally not considered synonymous with one another.
There's no need to worry about accuracy this time; just eyeball it.
"Should I measure the flour out?" "You can eyeball it if you want."
Fine. However, I'm running late and you need to keep it brief.
They spent time together in Paris.
We spent a few days together in Paris before coming back to Boston.
I can't believe I didn't get invited.
Just leave me alone. You're pathetic.
"Do you have a moment to talk with me, Tom?" "That's fine, but I've only got a minute or two to spend, so you'll need to keep whatever you have to say very brief."
Why did you do it, Tom?
He had the face of a daifuku.
Hi there!
The prince is waiting.
The princess is waiting.
Where?
I live in Tonga.
This is tiring. I don't want to kill myself for others!
After unsuccessfully attempting to fix her computer's browser, Christine had enough of it! Feeling drained, she slammed the lid of the laptop shut determined to be done with the volatile thing!
Goodbye everyone!
Stop acting like this Tom! I'm tired of this nonsense! Just have done with it already!
No!
This man is happy.
I'm sorry to say this, but I need to put my foot down! I'm not a charity! Unless you can solidly convince me that the devotion of my time to you is truly worth my while, I'm through! I mean it this time.
Tom is tormented every night by horrific nightmares.
Words rarely have only one meaning.
In regards to practicality, the world seems to be governed by varying degrees of fuzzy logic. In other words, things aren't so black and white as you may think at times.
If you give Tom any lead way, he'll probably just walk all over you.
The most accurate reflection of my feelings is that of a love-hate relationship.
I need to drop these useless perceptions to take full throttle over my life.
I'm going to allow my words to be the manifesto of my life.
My feelings may seem random but my thoughts are never!
If I want it so badly, I need to cultivate it. I have no choice.
Is there a place in Europe you want to go to?

I've never finished reading the books that I don't like.
She encouraged her children to learn Finnish.
Come on, Finnish isn't that hard.
I've been learning Finnish for over ten years, and I still have trouble understanding it.
If you're having trouble with Finnish, you know who to ask.
Go on, but in Finnish.
The Finns speak Finnish.
She only speaks Finnish in class.
She taught Finnish for 25 years.

She saw him crossing the road.
His biceps are very big.
We don't care what they say.
I can help, if you want.
I completely lost my train of thought
What was I gonna say?
What was I going to say?
Set me free!
"How did you find Egypt?" "Hot."
Let me go free, and I'll show myself grateful.
I am sure our dear guest would like to have a bath before he goes to bed.
The man enjoyed his bath, slept soundly, and set off early next morning.
From this time the man and his wife lived so happily together that it was a pleasure to see them.
Long, long ago an old couple lived in a village, and, as they had no children to love and care for, they gave all their affection to a little dog.
The dog was grateful to them for their kindness, and never left their side, whether they were in the house or out of it.
The old man was working in his garden, with his dog, as usual, close by.
He stooped down and pulled out a large box, filled quite full with shining gold pieces.
The box was so heavy that the old woman had to help to carry it home.
Now that he had made them rich, they gave him every day all that a dog likes best to eat, and the cushions on which he lay were fit for a prince.
There was once an emperor, very great and mighty, and he ruled over an empire so large that no one knew where it began and where it ended.
All the talk about world war is just a scarecrow.
The king had only one child, and that was a daughter, so he foresaw that she must be provided with a husband who would be fit to be king after him.
World war has become less likely because of global economic interdependence. It's not like the 1940's.
Why was I not informed?
You should never put on makeup while driving a car.
People who dream of mass destruction think that society hasn't constructed anything worthwhile.
The dream of world war may be linked to a linear religion.
Some Westerners no longer believe that their soul exists and that they have eternal life.
Technological retrogression will be unlikely.
One can't discount a global natural catastrophe like a meteor strike.
One can't discount a global disaster like a virulent plague.
The nuclear holocaust scenario is just old propaganda. Arsenals are limited and rusty.
I sell umbrellas.
Does it hurt here?
"Where does it hurt?" "Everywhere."
Atheism has become the philosophy of the new society of the old republic.

I usually never finish reading books that I find boring.
I've lost your email address.
I have to renew my passport.
I need to decide what to do.
I should've known that.
I knew you couldn't wait.

Until you told me, I had no idea.

A new theory by an anonymous author proposes that brontosauruses are rather thin at both ends, but that the middle part of their body is actually very thick.

One must consider the facts before the decision.
There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun.
When Rapunzel was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window.
Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy hair to me.
After a year or two, it came to pass that the King's son rode through the forest and went by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.
The King's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found.
I will willingly go away with thee, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with thee a skein of silk every time that thou comest, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and thou wilt take me on thy horse.
The enchantress clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground.
The King's son ascended, but he did not find his dearest Rapunzel above, but the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.
Thou wouldst fetch thy dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest; the cat has got it, and will scratch out thy eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to thee; thou wilt never see her more.
The King's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell, pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.
Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and contented.
Since our mother died we have had no happiness; our step-mother beats us every day, and if we come near her she kicks us away with her foot. Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over; and the little dog under the table is better off, for she often throws it a nice bit. May Heaven pity us. If our mother only knew!
In the evening they came to a large forest, and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk, that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep.
The next day when they awoke, the sun was already high in the sky.
Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife?
The King took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his palace, where the wedding was held with great pomp.
When she heard that they were so happy, and so well off, envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace, and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune.
As time went on, the Queen had a pretty little boy, and it happened that the King was out hunting; so the old witch took the form of the chamber-maid, went into the room where the Queen lay, and said to her, "Come, the bath is ready; it will do you good, and give you fresh strength; make haste before it gets cold."
The witch and her daughter carried the weakly Queen into the bath-room, and put her into the bath; then they shut the door and ran away. But in the bath-room they had made a fire of such deadly heat that the beautiful young Queen was soon suffocated.
The King went away, and did not find out that a false Queen was lying in the bed.
Then the King could not restrain himself; he sprang towards her, and said, "You can be none other than my dear wife." She answered, "Yes, I am your dear wife," and at the same moment she received life again, and by God's grace became fresh, rosy, and full of health.
Then she told the King the evil deed which the wicked witch and her daughter had been guilty of towards her. The King ordered both to be led before the judge, and judgment was delivered against them. The daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts, but the witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt.
It is now the time when the nuts are ripe, so let us go to the hill together and for once eat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away.
There were once on a time a king and a queen who lived happily together and had twelve children, but they were all boys.
Then the King said to his wife, "If the thirteenth child which thou art about to bring into the world, is a girl, the twelve boys shall die, in order that her possessions may be great, and that the kingdom may fall to her alone."
Dear mother, why art thou so sad?
The little daughter which their mother the Queen had given birth to, was now grown up; she was good of heart, and fair of face, and had a golden star on her forehead.
From whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?
Where do you come from and where are you going?
I am a king's daughter, and am seeking my twelve brothers, and I will walk as far as the sky is blue until I find them.
Then Benjamin saw that she was his sister, and said, "I am Benjamin, thy youngest brother." And she began to weep for joy, and Benjamin wept also, and they kissed and embraced each other with the greatest love.
She sought for the wood for cooking and herbs for vegetables, and put the pans on the fire so that the dinner was always ready when the eleven came. She likewise kept order in the little house, and put beautifully white clean coverings on the little beds, and the brothers were always contented and lived in great harmony with her.
My child, what hast thou done?
When they had lived happily together for a few years, the King's mother, who was a wicked woman, began to slander the young Queen, and said to the King, "This is a common beggar girl whom thou hast brought back with thee. Who knows what impious tricks she practises secretly!"
At first the King would not believe it, but the old woman urged this so long, and accused her of so many evil things, that at last the King let himself be persuaded and sentenced her to death.
A great fire was lighted in the courtyard in which she was to be burnt, and the King stood above at the window and looked on with tearful eyes, because he still loved her so much.
The King rejoiced when he heard that she was innocent, and they all lived in great unity until their death.
The wicked step-mother was taken before the judge, and put into a barrel filled with boiling oil and venomous snakes, and died an evil death.
Whoso wishes to touch him let him beware, for he will have to do with me!
Once on a time there was a king who had an only daughter.
Once on a time there was a king who had an only daughter. He was so proud and so fond of her, that he was in constant terror that something would happen to her if she went outside the palace, and thus, owing to his great love for her, he forced her to lead the life of a prisoner, shut up within her own rooms.
The princess did not like this at all, and one day she complained about it very bitterly to her nurse.
The nurse was a witch, though the king did not know it.
Your father loves you very dearly, as you know. Whatever you were to ask from him he would give you. The one thing he will not grant you is permission to leave the palace.
The princess next put on the bear's skin, which so completely changed her appearance, that no one could have known that she was a girl and not a bear.
Now it happened that the prince of that country was hunting with his dogs in the forest.
'Call off your dogs, or they will kill me. What harm have I ever done to you?' At these words, coming from a bear, the prince was so startled that for a moment he stood stock-still.
You may imagine the surprise of the prince's mother when she saw her son return accompanied by a bear, who at once set about doing the house-work better than any servant that the queen had ever seen.
Let me come to the ball; I, too, would like to dance.
But the only answer the prince made was to give the bear a kick, and to drive it out of the room.
The kind-hearted queen could not refuse her.
Then the bear ran to her wheelbarrow, threw off her bear's skin, and touched it with the magic wand that the witch had given her. In a moment the skin was changed into an exquisite ball dress woven out of moon-beams, and the wheel-barrow was changed into a carriage drawn by two prancing steeds.
Stepping into the carriage the princess drove to the grand entrance of the palace.
When she entered the ball-room, in her wondrous dress of moon-beams, she looked so lovely, so different from all the other guests, that everyone wondered who she was, and no one could tell where she had come from.
From the moment he saw her, the prince fell desperately in love with her, and all the evening he would dance with no one else but the beautiful stranger.
When the ball was over, the princess drove away in her carriage at full speed, for she wished to get home in time to change her ball dress into the bear's skin, and the carriage into the wheel-barrow, before anyone discovered who she was.
I do not know what is to become of me; I think I shall go mad, I am so much in love with that girl, and I have no means of finding out who she is.
And the bear's skin dropped off, and the beautiful girl stood before him, in the dress woven out of the star-light, and he saw that she was the stranger with whom he had fallen so deeply in love. And now she appeared to him a thousand times more beautiful than ever.
So they were married, and lived happily for many years, and reigned wisely over their kingdom.

A lightweight sensor attached to alpine swifts reveals that the small migratory birds can remain aloft for more than 200 days without touching down.
Breeding swifts will sleep in the nest, and what a relief that must be. Otherwise they sleep on the wing - the only bird known to do this.
Except when nesting, swifts spend their lives in the air, living on the insects caught in flight; they drink, feed, mate and sleep on the wing.
A common swift can spend its first two or three years on the wing before breeding, and making its first ever landing.
Swifts are the most aerial of birds and some, like the Common Swift, even sleep and mate on the wing. No other bird spends as much of its life in flight.
Until now, opinions differed over the question of whether birds could sleep while aloft.

Most of us still aren't eating enough fruit and vegetables.
Fruit and vegetables are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fibre.
Fruit and vegetables should make up over a third of the food we eat each day.
Eating smaller portions from smaller plates can help you eat less while not feeling hungry any quicker.
Stop eating high-calorie foods and swap them for a healthy, balanced alternative.
It is our reaction to hunger that can make us overeat or eat the wrong things.
Food is like a drug, and the same areas of the brain are activated by food as by drug addiction.
Hunger is caused by the brain reading changes in the levels of hormones and nutrients in the blood.
Hunger is our bodies' response to having eaten less than normal.
Hunger is a very powerful human instinct which can compel us to extremes of behaviour.
Hunger is our bodies' way of driving us to find food and eat to stay alive.

Mary is an outstanding businesswoman.
First of all, our hearts go out to the families of those who have been killed. Our prayers go to those who have been wounded. This is a devastating attack on all Americans. It is one that is particularly painful for the people of Orlando, but I think we all recognize that this could have happened anywhere in this country. And we feel enormous solidarity and grief on behalf of the families that have been affected.
We also have to make sure that it is not easy for somebody who decides they want to harm people in this country to be able to obtain weapons to get at them.
My final point is just to extend our deepest sympathies to the families of those who were affected and to send our prayers to those who are surviving and are in hospitals right now, and their family members hoping that they get better very soon.
In all of our efforts, foremost in our minds is the loss and the grief of the people of Orlando -- those who died, those who are still recovering, the families who have seen their loved ones harmed, the friends of ours who are lesbian and gay and bisexual and transgender who were targeted. I want to remind them that they are not alone. The American people, and our allies and friends all over the world, stand with you and are thinking about you, and are praying for you.
One of my first acts as President was to establish the White House Council on Women and Girls.
I want to thank all of you who worked so hard to make this event happen.
Fifty-four years ago, Katherine Johnson did the behind-the-scenes math to put a man in orbit. Today, almost 60 women have blasted into space themselves.
When I was growing up, fewer than 300,000 girls played high school sports. Today, because of Title IX, more than 3 million girls are on the field.
Women are leading America at every level of society, from Hollywood to Silicon Valley, from the c-suite to the federal bench to the Federal Reserve.
Our progress has been the result of countless ordinary women and men whose names will never be written into the history books or chiseled on monuments, but who dedicated their lives to ensuring that America lives up to its promise of liberty and justice for all.
We need equal pay for equal work.
We need paid family and sick leave.
When we had a cooperative Congress, we got a whole lot more done. So far, a lot of Republicans in Congress have been unwilling to act on these agenda items that I just mentioned.
The first bill I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.
We passed the Affordable Care Act to give more Americans the security of health care coverage so that not only people without health insurance could finally get it, but people who had health insurance were treated fairly, so that, for example, no insurer could charge you more just for being a woman.
I don't know why they charge so much.
We try to set a good example providing my staff with 12 weeks of paid parental leave.
We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure, and our boys to be assertive; that criticizes our daughters for speaking out, and our sons for shedding a tear.
We need to change the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality but gives men a pat on the back for theirs.
We need to change an Internet where women are routinely harassed and threatened when they go online.
We need to keep changing a culture that shines a particularly unforgiving light on women and girls of color. About how they look, about how they feel, about what they should or should not do.
Rosa Parks wasn't simply a tired seamstress who sat down by accident. She was a civil rights leader with the eye of a strategist and the heart of a warrior.
God bless you. God bless the United States of America.
Today, as Americans, we grieve the brutal murder -- a horrific massacre -- of dozens of innocent people. We pray for their families, who are grasping for answers with broken hearts.
This is an especially heartbreaking day for all our friends -- our fellow Americans -- who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.
No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.
As we go together, we will draw inspiration from heroic and selfless acts -- friends who helped friends, took care of each other and saved lives. In the face of hate and violence, we will love one another. We will not give in to fear or turn against each other.

May God bless the Americans we lost this morning. May He comfort their families. May God continue to watch over this country that we love.

A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels.
The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.
Past thinking and methods did not prevent world wars. Future thinking must prevent wars.

I believe in Spinoza's God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.
A dictatorship means muzzles all round and consequently stultification. Science can flourish only in an atmosphere of free speech.
The belief in an external world independent of the perceiving subject is the basis of all natural science.
Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.
Why is it nobody understands me and everybody likes me?
A human being is a part of the whole, called by us "Universe," a part limited in time and space.
I believe, indeed, that overemphasis on the purely intellectual attitude, often directed solely to the practical and factual, in our education, has led directly to the impairment of ethical values.
