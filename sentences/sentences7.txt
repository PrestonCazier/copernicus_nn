I've never tried.
I've noticed that Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
It takes time to develop political awareness.
A dog bite is more serious than a mosquito bite.
It's the bite of a spider.
I can't lift boxes over thirty kilograms.
I can't pick this lock.
I can't say I'm shocked.
I did some extra credit work in order to pass that class.
I didn't expect Tom to be there.
I didn't know you were that good at French.
I didn't realize you could speak French.
I didn't realize you were serious.
I didn't think I should drive.
I don't feel very well. I should go home.
I don't know how much longer I can do this.

I don't know how you can tolerate doing this over and over again.
I don't know what it's for.

I just couldn't keep my eyes open.
I just couldn't let that happen.
I just couldn't make Tom understand.
I just couldn't resist doing that.
I just couldn't say no to Tom.
I just couldn't stay away.
I just couldn't take it anymore.

I just did what anybody would've done.
I just did what I thought you'd want me to do.
I just didn't feel like getting up.
I just didn't know what to do.

I'd say you've had enough to drink.
I'd recognize Tom's voice anywhere.
I'd like you to handle this matter.
I'd have to be an idiot to do that.

You got the answer right.
You are lost, aren't you?

Why don't you take a nap?
Why don't people like me?
What are the differences?

Where did you get that hat?
For a couple of years now I've believed that at all times I can be wrong about anything, including that belief.
Since my mind governs my thought or rather is my thought, I have no guarantee that I am more correct by realising something that has not only been made by the same mind as its user but also, the chance of my realising this belief is dictated by my mind, which is prone to opinion and hiding of facts.
This not only means that my theory is not entirely holeproof but also that I am no more or less wrong for thinking so or not.

Intelligence is our ability to begin understanding (or adapting to) new information, regardless of past familiarity.

Learning a new language is like meeting someone for the first time who always claims you are wrong, and worse - has the ability to prove it.
