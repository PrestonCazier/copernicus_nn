Anyone who criticizes him is asking for trouble.
I absolutely will not speak to that fellow again!
I've done with him for the future.
I don't get along with that guy.

He lives a freewheeling life. I think he ought to settle down a little.

We were talking about him when he appeared.
His appearance animated the party.
There was an awkward silence when he appeared.
I have no idea where he is at present.
I think it's true that he wasn't at the scene.
All that he says is true.
Whatever he says is true.
What he says is false.
What he says is very important.
Admitting what he says, I still think that he is in the wrong.
Few students could understand what he said.
He says firefighting is a feast or famine job.
What he said turned out to be false.
What he said cannot be true.
Don't take any notice of what he said.
Some of the things he said got under my skin.
Gradually the true meaning of what he said began to dawn on me.
What he said may well be true.
What he said is, in a sense, true.
What he said was by no means true.
What he said then shocked me.
What he said is not true.
What he said counts for nothing.
What he has said is true of them.
What he said turned out to be true.
Do tell me what he said.
Do you believe what he said?
I remember what he said.
Only a few understood what he said.
Everything he said was right.
What he said was to the contrary.
I got the gist of what he was saying.
What he is saying doesn't make sense.
What he says sounds very sensible to me.
He was heard to shut the door behind him.
It is evident that he has made a mistake.
I like him.
I understand him to be happy.
I know quite clearly what he thinks.
It is Egypt that he wants to visit.
The dog followed him wherever he went.
It is advisable for him to go.
It is definite that he will go.
I don't care whether he leaves or stays.
His success delighted his parents.
It is doubtful whether he will pass.
I would like to have seen him before he left the country.
He hasn't been heard from since he left the country.
I copied in my notebook whatever he wrote on the blackboard.
I wish he were here now.
I know nothing as to where he is now.
Make certain where he is now.
We are worried about where he is now.
It is certain that he is in Hawaii now.
Where he will live doesn't interest us.
We were surprised when we saw him in the office this morning.
I am uncertain when he will come next.
I don't know if he will visit us next Sunday.
You should read such a good book as he is reading now.
Sport has made him what he is.
What he is today he owes to his father.
I don't know the reason he is absent today.
Do you know the reason why he cut class today?
It is no laughing matter that he couldn't graduate from university this year.
The dinner he ate this evening was inferior in quality to that dinner.
His reelection seems sure.
What he needs most is a good job.
It serves him right that he missed the last train.
He was the first to arrive.
He was the first person to arrive.
He was the first to come.
His boast that he is the best pitcher is true.
There is no doubt about his ability.
There is no room to doubt that he is a gifted artist.
I must make sure whether he is at home or not.
The model plane they built was fragile.
The fish he caught yesterday is still alive.
He came to see you yesterday.
What he said yesterday is not consistent with what he had said last week.
What he said yesterday is not true.
What he told me yesterday is a white lie.
It is doubtless that he was murdered.
I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered.
The number of prey they killed was the same.
Whether he agrees or not, we won't change our plans.
He fell in with a strange man when he was taking a walk.
It doesn't matter whether he agrees or not.
It makes no difference whether he agrees or not.
It is uncertain whether he will agree or not.
I don't care whether he agrees or not.
I am certain that he will quit his job.
He has every reason to quit his job.
There must be something wrong with the pen he is using.
His constant complaints aroused my rage.
I thought it strange that he didn't turn up.
He is certain to turn up.
Let's wait here until he turns up.
I've known him ever since he was a child.
He is actually not the manager.
The estate went to his daughter when he died.
What will become of the children after his death?
The news of his death spread abroad.
I was surprised at the news of his death.
It was yesterday that he died.
It is a great pity he was given up for lost.
The evening he died was stormy.
He has been dead for three years.
It has been ten years since he died.
She still hated him, even after he died.
Ten years have passed since he died.
With his death, the oldest family in this village died out.
He has been dead for five years.
Three years have passed since he died.
Either he or I am to attend the meeting.
I don't know whether he'll join us or not.
I wish he were on our team.
That he refused our proposal was big surprise to us.
If only he would marry me!
It is surprising that he should have said such things of me.
It never occurred to me that he might insist on treating me to dinner.
I wonder what he promised to do for me.
I hope he will see me and listen to my future plans.
What he told me proved true.
He is the chief of my department.
Either he is to blame, or I am.
He is wrong or I am.
Either he or I have to attend the convention.
Whether he agrees to my opinion or not, I will do the work.
He has my fate in his hands.
What he finds in my face I can't guess.
He's charging me roughly four times as much as he charged when he started cutting my lawn.
I think it doubtful whether he understood my explanation.
He went in place of me.
It is necessary that he follow my advice.
If he had taken my advice, he would now be rich.
I think it was a mistake that you didn't take my advice.
I don't know whether he's younger or older than I am.
He went into the water before me.
It never occurred to me that he loved me.
It is not likely that he did it on purpose to deceive me.
I felt like hitting him when he tried to cheat me.
He chose to have me stay.
I was surprised because he lifted me up with ease.
I saw him looking at me.
I know he is watching me.
It has dawned upon me that he does not like me.
He came to my rescue.
I began to understand the reason why he hated me.
I expected that he would visit me.
It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
I don't know whether he will agree to our plan or not.
It is true that he got full marks on the test.
It is no wonder that he passed the examination.
That he passed the exam is surprising to us.
I was pleased to hear that he had succeeded in the examination.
I'm glad that he passed the exam.
It is certain that he passed the examination.
I take it for granted that he will succeed in the examination.
I was informed of his failure in the examination.
It was a bitter disappointment to him when he failed his examination.
Never did I expect that he would fail the examination.
It is certain that he will pass the examination.
I can't ensure that he will pass the examination.
Is it any wonder that he failed in the examination?
His failing the test is no laughing matter.
It is truly regrettable that he failed the examination.
It'll serve him right if he fails the exam; he doesn't study at all.
He is certain to win the game.
It was pure chance that he won the game.
The dog who he kept sometimes barked at strangers.
No wonder that he has failed in the enterprise.
It is not because he had a faculty for business but because he was lucky that he succeeded in business.
It was fortunate that he was taken to a nearby hospital right away after the accident.
I accept that he was telling the truth.
He is the president of the company in fact.
I question whether he'll come in time.
I doubt if he will come on time.
If only he arrives in time!
You can rely upon his being punctual.
You cannot calculate on his punctuality.
There is not much possibility of his coming on time.
What he did next was quite a surprise to me.
There is no knowing what he will do next.
His next two books were novels.
He was passing by on his bicycle when he heard a cry for help.
It took him three months to learn to ride a bicycle.
I am very much surprised to hear that he got badly injured in a motorcar accident.
He can't possibly write the letter by himself.
There is a picture of his own painting.
The woman who he thought was his aunt was a stranger.
That was all he needed to operate his computer.
It looked almost impossible for him to finish his book.
He may well be proud of his daughter.
It is certain that he helped them for the benefit of himself.
There is a rumor that he has resigned.
There is no reason why he should resign.
There are rumors that he will resign.
There is a rumor about that he is going to resign.
I didn't know he had decided to leave his job.
It is not surprising that he resigned.
Because he was unemployed, their wedlock failed.
I was surprised that he had failed.
It is no wonder that he failed.
His failure was due to his idleness.
It is no wonder that he has failed.
I am afraid he will make a mistake.
That he will fail is certain.
It is hardly conceivable to me that he will fail.
I expect him to get over the shock of his failure.
The ease with which he answered the question surprised us.
I found it impossible to explain what he is really like.
The photo he showed added color to his story.
He was about to apologize when the man punched him in the face.
He kindly drove me to the station.
His car was seriously damaged when he backed into a telephone pole.
He may well be proud of his car.
Someone saw him wash his car.
I saw him wash the car.
He guaranteed my debt.
We must take into account the fact that he is young.
You had better take his youth into account.
He was an early riser in his youth.
Whether he has the operation depends upon the availability of the organ.
It has slowly dawned upon us that he will not help.
Tell me the reason why he was fired.
Is there any possibility of his resigning?
I am positive that he has finished.
The place where he lives is far from town.
There were no flowers or trees on his street.
Do you know the town where he lives?
Would you see to it that they get properly fed?
He played an important part.
As soon as he went out, it began to rain.
It began to rain when he went out.
His primary reason for going out was to see Patty.
I heard him go out.
As soon as he left, the bank closed.
His departure means that there will be peace in the house.
Three and a half hours have passed since he left.
The medicine he had prescribed failed to take effect.
It was ten years ago that he first came to Japan.
His oral agreement may not mean anything without his signed contract.
The novels he wrote are interesting.
Had it not been for his help, I couldn't have finished the report.
She would have failed but for his help.
I don't doubt that he will help me.
We took it for granted that he would help us.
On few occasions was he willing to ask for any help.
I'm always surprised at the way he talks to girls.
It looks like he's winning.
I'll bet 10,000 yen on his winning.
There is a good chance that he will win.
There is little chance of his winning.
Whether he will be offered the scholarship or not is still in the air.
His writing of a novel surprised us.
I'm satisfied if he has become any wiser.
I took it for granted that he would consent.
When he smiled, the children saw his long, gray teeth.
You mustn't despise him because he didn't win a prize.
His jumbo jet ought to have arrived in Osaka now.
When does his train arrive at Kyoto?
It is important for him to get the job.
Never have I heard him complaining about his meals.
He said he would pay for the dinner.
I can assure you of his reliability.
I was on the spot when he had a heart attack.
I hope he will succeed in his new position.
He is a new addition to the teaching staff.
To me he's no different from a million other dull middle aged men.
While he was reading a newspaper, his dog was lying beside him.
He can't know the truth.
It is true that he stole the pearl.
It is true that he couldn't know the truth.
He is anything but a gentleman.
I like him not because he is kind but because he is honest.
He thoughtfully gave me a helping hand.
You shouldn't let him get away with cheating.
That he is a man of character cannot be denied.
I doubt that he can make a speech in public.
No one in the neighborhood believed him to be a genius even after he had achieved world-wide fame.
The news that he had succeeded delighted them.
He has succeeded by virtue of his constant efforts rather than his talent.
He succeeded, not because he made efforts, but because he happened to be lucky.
His success is the result of hard work.
It is through hard work that he succeeded, not through good luck.
He owes his success to good luck.
He owes his success only to good luck.
It's natural that he should have succeeded.
He owed his success to both ability and industry.
It is no wonder that he has succeeded.
Never did I dream that he would succeed.
Whether he will succeed or not depends upon his health.
His success depends on his efforts.
There is little doubt as to whether he will succeed or not.
Whether he will succeed or not depends on his efforts.
It is certain that he will succeed.
I hope that he will succeed.
That he will succeed is certain.
Who can guarantee his success?
He couldn't possibly succeed.
Let's help him so that he will succeed.
There is little, if any, possibility of his success.
There was a strong likelihood of his succeeding.
There is little hope of his success.
There is very little hope of his success.
There isn't any hope of his success.
I led him to expect success.
We have some doubt as to whether he has chosen the right course.
I admit that he is right.
I am of the opinion that he is right.
I don't know exactly when he will arrive.
I doubt if he is honest.
We cannot gainsay that he is honest.
I will answer for his honesty.
There are sufficient grounds for believing he is honest.
How can we be sure of his honesty?
I found him honest.
There is no doubt that he is honest.
His honesty is beyond doubt.
Admitting that he is honest, I doubt his ability.
I would never question his honesty.
Granted that he is honest, but I doubt his ability.
We respect him all the more for his honesty.
I am proud of his honesty.
Her honesty is beyond question.
I answer for his honesty.
I answer for his honesty, for I know him well.
He can't be an honest man.
There is no way to confirm that he is alive.
That he is alive is certain.
I was relieved to hear that he was alive.
I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
There is no hope of his being alive.
There is little, if any, hope of his being alive.
That he survived was remarkable.
It was in 1950 that he was born.
The village in which he was born is far from here.
It snowed heavily in the morning he was born.
Where was he born and raised?
He brings home the bread and butter.
I vouch for his sincerity.
His red face showed his anger.
His constant insults aroused my anger.
The examination he took last week was very hard.
He is the boy of whom I spoke the other day.
He is specializing in the study of economics.
It is apparent that he will win the election.
Is there any possibility that he'll win the election?
There is little hope of his winning the election.
Because he is good, it does not follow that he is wise.
It's unusual for him to get up early.
I believe him to get up early.
Do you think he is the guy that broke the window?
The distance he ran was much greater than had been expected.
I saw him running.
The apples which he sent to me were delicious.
It is only natural that he be proud of his son.
He's every reason to be proud of his son.
He is justly proud of his son.
It's not surprising that he be proud of his son.
He may well be proud of his sons.
I've never heard him speak ill of others.
He batted three runners home.
I cannot help his being lazy.
His colleagues gave him a present when he retired.
No wonder he was arrested.
It is clear that he has made a big mistake.
He acted like he owned the place.
The bigger the words he used, the harder it was to find anything in them.
His mother's prophecy that he would be a great musician was later fulfilled.
I don't know whether he's a college student or not.
I really like him!
To his great joy, his team won the game.
Much to his surprise, he found his dog dead.
It never occurred to me that he was a prison-breaker.
After he bumped into the shelf, the priceless china fell and shattered into fragments.
He sent me a birthday card.
He run fastest by a long chalk.
If only he had known!
I knew that he was trying to use that money to become governor.
His delay made the situation all the worse.
Give him this message the moment he arrives.
I'll give him this message the moment he arrives.
Let's leave as soon as he arrives.
I stepped aside so that he could come in.
That he grew up in China is well-known.
His knowledge of Chinese enables us to carry out our plan smoothly.
I took it for granted that he would become a member.
He intervened and settled the matter peacefully for the time being.
Hardly had he finished breakfast when the telephone rang.
Hardly had he finished breakfast when the doctor came.
He was brilliant in the morning sun.
It was yesterday that I saw him walking down the street.
May he live long!
We saw him walking across the street.
He was seen crossing the street.
We saw him walk across the street.
When he was about to pass, the Sphinx jumped in front of him.
I stepped aside so that he could pass.
The errors apparent in his results are due more to carelessness than faulty procedures.
I couldn't help laughing when I saw him lying face down covered with mud.
The gun went off while he was cleaning it, and the bullet almost struck his wife.
You can easily tell that he is a genius.
That he is a genius is clear to everyone.
It is not too much to say that he is a genius.
I saw him enter the store.
He must have missed the train.
It is certain that he missed the train.
I had been reading a book for some time when he called.
We were in the middle of lunch when he gave me a ring.
Ten years have passed since he went to America.
The crowd cheered when he appeared.
I was annoyed with him for his interruptions.
Naturally he got angry.
I think it natural that he got angry.
No wonder he is so angry.
It is rare for him to get angry.
It is quite natural that he should be angry.
I think it natural for him to get angry.
It's natural for him to get angry.
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
There's no denying his ability as a pitcher, but he is rather injury-prone.
It is half a year since he went to Tokyo.
On his getting to Tokyo, I'll telephone you.
I think it certain that he went to Tokyo.
No one went to the station to see him off when he left for Tokyo.
Needless to say he is one of the best writers of the present generation.
There was a long interval before he answered.
There was a long interval before he replied.
The train will have started by the time he arrives.
No sooner had he arrived than the bus departed.
Let me know when he will arrive.
He may well be proud of his bright son.
Where the heck does he work?
There is no need for him to work.
It was extraordinary that he did not agree.
It is strange that he should have lost his way.
He was seen crossing the road.
The results he has got are, in the main, satisfactory.
The crowd yelled when he scored a goal.
He did the work on his own.
Let me know why it was that he came suddenly.
I don't know at all why he quit his job suddenly.
His sudden appearance surprised us all.
I was surprised at his sudden appearance.
His sudden appearance gave rise to trouble.
He was seen to go upstairs.
He came to Japan as a child.
He has been in Japan for three years.
It has been two years since he came to Japan.
He is a famous physicist not only in Japan, but in the world.
It has been three months since he left Japan.
It has been ten years since he left Japan.
The door shut after him.
He came in, and at the same time the bell rang.
I had been reading for an hour when he came in.
I had been reading a book for about an hour when he came in.
Did you notice him coming in?
It was dark when he came in.
The atmosphere became strained when he came.
I had been studying English for two hours when he came in.
I had been reading a book when he came in.
There is no hope of his being appointed.
I would have taken care of him if I had known that he was ill with a fever.
It is true that he went bankrupt.
The first item he bought was an alarm clock.
We took it for granted that he had been punished.
He deserves punishment.
We thought it natural that he should be punished.
He's in charge of the sales department.
He or I am to blame.
It was uncertain whether he would marry her.
I agree to his marrying her.
There is no question that he will marry her.
It is a pity that he can not marry her.
The day came at last when he had to part from her.
It stands to reason that he should apologize to her.
It was cruel of him to say such things to her.
It is cruel of him to say such things to her.
He may well get angry with her.
That he is in love with her is true.
He told her and she smiled.
We couldn't stop him from hitting her.
No one knows whether he loves her or not.
That he loved her was certain.
There's nothing that can be done about his feeling sorry for her.
It's clear from his actions that he loves her.
It was obvious to everybody that he was tired.
We were all ears when he started to tell us his secret.
Spectators gathered as he climbed into the plane.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed in the plane crash.
The picture painted by him is of great value.
Look at the picture which he painted.
He cannot have been ill.
He can't have been ill.
Let's keep it secret that he is ill.
Can it be true that he is ill?
It seems obvious that he is unable to swim.
You must allow for his being ill.
The fact that he was sick was not very impressive to her.
It is true that he is ill.
It never occurred to me that he might be ill.
He can't be ill.
You ought to have known that he was sick in bed.
It was the bad weather that caused his illness.
He fell ill three years ago.
Just because he is poor, it does not follow that he is unhappy.
She despises him only because he is poor.
To my surprise, he failed in the exam.
Everything chose to go wrong during his absence.
His rudeness was conscious, not accidental.
He complains with good reason.
He is managing the business for his father.
He will succeed to his father's property.
His face says that he lost.
The news that he had got injured was a shock to her.
It is an open secret that he deals in weapons.
He entered the room, to be confronted by a policeman.
Hardly had he entered the room, when she burst into tears.
He was seen to enter the room.
I noticed him sneak into the room.
He burst into the room.
He had no sooner gone out of the room than all of them burst out laughing.
I heard him go out of the room.
Seeing that he is angry, there must be some misunderstanding.
We had a hard time doing the job because he was always complaining.
In the years he had worked so hard for equality, new laws had been passed.
He painted the picture which is on the wall.
I didn't know he had decided to leave.
No wonder he didn't feel like studying.
As he was studying, the door was suddenly flung open.
She was all eyes as he opened the jewelry box.
I had just finished my homework when he visited me.
We had known him for five years when he died.
His death was partly my fault.
They say that he has been dead for two years.
It is three years since he died.
I ran after him with a pile of papers that he'd left behind.
I know he is busy.
It is impossible that he is busy.
I know that he was busy.
That he was busy is true.
There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
All he wanted was time to finish his painting.
He put the idea into my head.
I could read between the lines that he wanted me to resign.
He had been reading for two hours when she came in.
You can count on him to tell the truth.
His failure to tell me the truth caused an accident.
It is doubtful whether he is telling the truth.
It's no good his trying to find the true reason.
I can't figure out what he really wants.
He writes a daily journal, and that inspired me to try doing the same thing, but in English.
It is true that he goes abroad every year.
His perfect score brought the class average up.
A burglar broke in while he was asleep.
He was about to fall asleep, when he heard his name called.
We are not alone in believing that he is not guilty.
It goes without saying that he is not guilty.
We have every reason to believe him innocent.
I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
They rejoiced when they heard he was safe.
Make certain that he returned home safely.
The news of his safe arrival delighted his family.
I'm anxious for him to return safe.
There is no hope of his coming back safe.
That he is innocent is quite certain.
It was evident to all of us that he was innocent.
No one believes that he is innocent.
If he is innocent, it follows that his wife is guilty.
It is preferable that he gets there by tomorrow.
I wonder whether he'll make it here on time tomorrow. Want to bet a can of juice on it?
I saw him sawing a tree.
She inferred from his silence that he was angry.
Do you think his silence denotes guilt?
I felt myself insulted when he kept silence.
We didn't move so that we would not wake him up.
Let's wait until he wakes up.
When he awoke it was day.
As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
Tell him so, when he comes back.
Give him the message when he comes back.
I will tell him so when he comes back.
When he came back, the woman had walked off.
The hope of his return encouraged me.
How about waiting here until he gets back?
Wait here till he comes back.
There was nothing for it but to wait till he came back.
Whatever will become of his wife if he does not return?
I will finish it by the time he comes back.
We have to stay a decision until he comes back.
I will wait here until he comes back.
Let's wait till he comes back.
It makes no difference to me whether he likes baseball or football.
I want to meet him to see whether or not he gives me useful information.
What do you think made him break his promise?
It is doubtful whether he will keep his word.
It goes without saying that he keeps his promise.
It wasn't easy for him to keep his promise.
He is famous as a good doctor.
He is likely to win the championship.
I could not but admire his courage.
We know him to be a brave man.
It never occurred to me that he might fail his friend.
They say he is guilty, but I believe the contrary.
It cannot be denied that he is guilty.
The fact remains that he is guilty.
I know him for a man of ability.
I see that he is an able man.
The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
It is not so much money as fame that he wanted.
I was taking a bath when he came.
I had written the letter when he came.
When he came, I was doing my homework.
We will leave as soon as he comes.
Let's start as soon as he comes.
Let me know in no time when he comes.
I'll tell him so when he comes.
Let's do it when he comes.
Will you let me know when he comes?
Ask him about it when he comes.
I expected that he would come.
Whether he comes or not, we'll begin the party on time.
I bet five dollars that he will not come.
Seeing that he has not come, he may be on a trip.
It was extraordinary that he did not come.
If he doesn't come, we won't go.
Whether he comes or not, the result will be the same.
Whether he comes or not, I'll go.
It doesn't matter whether he comes or not.
It matters little whether he comes or not.
It is doubtful whether he will come or not.
It is uncertain whether he is coming or not.
I don't know whether he comes or not.
It isn't certain whether he will come or not.
It makes no difference whether he will come or not.
I thought it doubtful whether he would come or not.
I doubt if he will come.
I don't know whether he will come or not.
I am doubtful whether he will come.
It makes no difference whether he comes or not.
I think it possible that he may come.
There's no possibility of his coming.
That he will come is certain.
I telephoned to make sure that he was coming.
The news that he would come, quickly got abroad.
You had better be ready in case he comes.
He will blow our party.
I hope that he will come.
It matters little whether he comes late or not.
It is certain that he will come.
It is no good waiting for him to come.
I will wait here till he comes.
Be waiting here until he comes.
Let's wait till he comes.
Is there any likelihood of his coming?
Let me know the time when he will come.
I will get through with my homework before he comes.
It is a pity that he can't come.
There is no guarantee that he'll be back next week.
It is on his father that he depends.
His disappointment was obvious to everyone.
There is no denying that he is clever.
I remember him as a cute, bright little boy.
He is acting for the chief director.
His standing up was the signal for everybody to start leaving the room.
He cannot have gone against his parents.
They shut his water off because he didn't pay the bill.
It was only recently that he got well.
The girl with whom he fell in love left him after a few months.
