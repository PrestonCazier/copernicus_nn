Leaders establish unity of purpose and direction of the organization.
They should create and maintain the internal environment in which people can become fully involved in achieving the organization's objectives.
People at all levels are the essence of an organization and their full involvement enables their abilities to be used for the organization's benefit.
A desired result is achieved more efficiently when activities and related resources are managed as a process.
Identifying, understanding and managing interrelated processes as a system contributes to the organization's effectiveness and efficiency in achieving its objectives.
Continual improvement of the organization's overall performance should be a permanent objective of the organization.
Effective decisions are based on the analysis of data and information.
An organization and its suppliers are interdependent and a mutually beneficial relationship enhances the ability of both to create value.

Why do you need them?
I regret that I did that.
I want more than that.
I'm trying to do that.
No one's denying that.
I can help with that.
We took care of that.
I believe all that.
I'm sorry for that.
