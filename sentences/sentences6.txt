Welcome to Boston.
We'll never have to do this again.
We sure ate a lot of hot dogs today. I never want to see another hot dog as long as I live.
We need to do things differently.
We might as well wait until Tom gets here.
We might as well go ahead and do that now.
We might as well ask Tom to come, too.
We have to get that document back before Tom shows it to anyone.
We have a long ways to go.
We hardly ever see each other anymore. We might as well be strangers.
Warn Tom that Mary is looking for him.
Warn me never to go there again.
Unless Tom is sober, I don't want him helping us.
Unfortunately, I missed all the fun.
Trust is earned.
Tom is the kind of guy that a girl could fall in love with.
Tom carved his initials on the large oak tree in front of the school.
Three of Tom's friends went to Mary's party.
Those are nice.
Those are mine.
This would be a lot easier if you would help.
This wasn't an easy decision for us.
This was all a mistake.
This time we won.
This smells bad, but it tastes good.
This should be interesting.
This seems risky.

This one's yours.
This one's Tom's.
This movie is supposed to be very good.
This job is kind of boring.
This isn't possible.
This isn't possible without Tom's help.
This isn't funny.
This isn't for you.
This isn't as hard as it looks.
This isn't as easy as it looks.
This isn't a party.
This isn't a joke.
This is your last chance.
This is weird.
This is very fresh.
This is useless.
This is the third time I've heard this song today.
This is the second time Tom has been here this week.
This is the only way to get Tom to stop.
This is the last time I'm going to tell you this.
This is the last piece of cake.
This is the best.
This is the best guitar in the store.
This is suicide. We shouldn't be attempting to do this.
This is so weird.
This is ridiculous.

This is my wife.
This is my son.
This is my place.
This is my phone.
This is my painting.
This is my husband.
This is my grandfather.
This is my fault.

This is a very profitable business.
This is a nice place.
This is a nice place for a picnic.
This is a joke.
This is a good place to pitch a tent.
This doesn't seem to make sense.

They'll take care of Tom.
They won't tell us anything.
They want to have a meeting with you.
They took Tom away on a stretcher.
They think you killed Tom and took his money.
They ruined it.
They never did an autopsy.
They might not notice that Tom isn't here.
They haven't hurt me.

They didn't even know where to go.

They didn't even know what they were looking at.
They didn't even know what they had found.
They didn't even know we were there.

There's still time.
There's something Tom isn't telling Mary.

There were three women standing at the bar.
There were almost no cars in the parking lot.
There was a tap at the door.
There was a stack of newspapers in the corner of the room.
There was a bullet hole in the windshield.
There must be some mistake.
There must be another way we can help Tom.
There must be a way we can convince Tom to work for us.
There may be another way to do this.
There is one problem.
There is nothing I can do to change that.
There is no other explanation.
There is a crowd of women around Tom.
There are only two correct answers.

We've taken a long hard look at your sales-directed communication and decided to buy some of the weed that you smoke.
He finished reading the letter.
Men never do good unless necessity drives them to it.
The dog is afraid of the horse.
Men ought either to be well treated or crushed, because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, but of more serious ones they cannot. Therefore, the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such a kind that he cannot take revenge.
It is much safer to be feared than loved.

She advised her not to go.

He did it out of curiosity.
She did it out of curiosity.
What have we done?
When are we going to do it?

No I can't. It's too big!

I will teach you.

Think for a moment.
I'm so tired. I'm not even sure whether I'll be able to survive this day.
I keep thinking night and day about you.
I think about you all the time.
I think about you all day long.
Tom asked Mary to help him reformat the hard disk.
"Man is mortal." That's my opinion. But if we've already been born, there's nothing to be done about it, we must live for a little...

This is an instructive book.

It is absolutely necessary that you drink the medicine before sleeping.
I would like to ask a question.
If the address changes, please contact us.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
Normally, which discussion forums do French people use to talk about politics and similar things?
What do you want then?
The new plan has been very successful.
Hello, have you already eaten?
The meat has begun to rot.
Will you be here tomorrow?
I want to be alone!
The engine started again.

I'd love to be able to spend more time with you, but I have to get back to work.
You should plan to come with us the next time we go camping.
You should have been at the party last night. It was a lot of fun.
I reckon that I'm right.
I think love does not exist.
Hearing the news, she turned pale.
Hearing the news, he turned pale.
It's the world's oldest profession.

It's as old as the world.

He has small feet.
I'm a sculpture.
I am a sculpture.
We think too much and feel too little.
Better leave it!
Tom was an orphan.
What is your advice?
I don't feel like it anyway!
He is going to climb that mountain someday.
That old guy is really nice.
I have taken my medication.
He disappeared.
Are you gonna pay for it?
Did Tom, by any chance, let Mary drive the car?
It's a deadly poison!
Doctor, it's the wrong leg!
He's not dead yet; we're bringing him here.
It was a certainty that the inhabitants of this island had committed horrible crimes.
The young woman, supported by Tom, remained a few moments without talking, looking at the island that was disappearing on the horizon.
Tom wanted to find out who was the artist who was playing violin in such a manner in an Arkansas forest.
Mary! cried out the young man trembling; Mary, you here, and in such a state?
What horrible events took place? Where are you parents? What happened to your husband?
Tom didn't expect to encounter a human being in a place where a squirrel would have thought twice about entering.
They're all dead! All dead! All dead!
I prefer your eau de vie to your conversation.
I prefer your brandy to your conversation.
"But what will happen to Mary while I'm gone?", said Georgina anxiously.
When Tom came back from this long trip he seemed not to enjoy his home country anymore.
Alert! Tom, open your eyes, something is going on at the beach.
"Are you sure it's a human bone?", said Tom while putting his shoes back on.
Tom had told the sailors what had happened.
Throw him in the water!
What! Holk had a son? But he was not married.
We went bear hunting together the other day.
My father is boneheaded, and when he has an idea, everything is decided: there's nothing more we can do.
We need a steamboat.
Would there be traitor among us?
The island was therefore a sure haven for all criminals who had run from the law.
Mary, even though the daughter of a mere farmer, has manners that betray a distinguished upbringing.
What do you call this beautiful young man who came with these ladies?
God! What a beard you have! You look terrible! You're going to scare away the children.
The first victim was one of my best friends and his loss caused me a great deal of grief; the second victim was merely a German.
Be careful, don't remove the cap. It's arsenic!
The nice young man, in order to avoid embarrassing questions, presented the crazy woman as his sister.
This woman had the task of cleaning the cabin, and not of taking care in the evenings of the mental health of the passengers.
Now, my young man, jump out the window!
I would like to know if he knows that Mary lives near here.
The matter is more serious than you think.
Tom, my friend, I know that you loved me, but I could not be yours.
Give me that bottle. This "brandy" tastes good; where does it come from?
"Mary, will you answer my question?" asked Adèle while trying to control her excitement.
All of a sudden, the door opened and a man entered the room.
Man, if he is not the largest, is certainly the most dangerous of ferocious animals. He kills for pleasure.
In the name of God, protect me from this crazy woman!
Quick! Quick! I hear footsteps, hide!
Mary, you poor child, where have you been? What happened to you?
Let me put on my glasses since I can't hear you.
Is it so difficult to write?
It's annoying.
It's annoying to hear people talking loudly in a library.
That loud music is annoying.
That's annoying.
Is this annoying?
Am I annoying you?
That sound is extremely annoying.
That's pretty annoying.
That's an annoying habit.
Do you find that annoying?
I'm not annoying anyone, am I?
Tom seems to find that annoying.
I told you Tom was really annoying.
Tom is just as annoying as Mary.
I can see how that might be annoying.
It's just one of those annoying buzzwords.
You're starting to get really annoying.
That's the most annoying song I've ever heard.
It doesn't annoy me.
It doesn't bother me.
A slow-worm is a limbless lizard, not a snake.
The two of you are the most annoying people I've ever met.
You're just as annoying as you were the last time I met you.
There were a lot of annoying insects flying around.
There's nothing more annoying than a group of young girls all trying to talk at the same time.
A slowworm is a limbless lizard, not a snake.
Tom seems to be annoyed.
Tom seems to be annoyed with himself.
Tom seems to be slightly annoyed.
That sound annoyed me at first, but now I've gotten used to it.
Tom was annoyed by Mary's silence.
There are mosquitoes even in Greece.
What an idiot!
False friends are pairs of words in two languages that are similar in spelling or pronunciation, but differ in meaning.
Bow to no man.
Judging from the expression on her face, she was worried.
Tom wanted to find out who the artist was who was playing violin in such a manner in an Arkansan forest.
The money that he had been promised was not, according to him, a sufficient reward for such a service.
Does the snake not bite when we step on it?
Property prices are going up.
"It seems that you know the country well." "I think so", answered Tom, smiling.
Oh, I love life in the woods, declared Tom suddenly after a long silence, while he was relaxing on his blanket.
Ah! my dear girl, I would love to see you become the wife of a good farmer and be one of our neighbours.
When I said that I had killed a panther with nothing but a knife, this means that I did not have any dogs with me and that I did not use a rifle.
Well, Bill, I am pleased to see you here.
There's something in the face of this man that's repugnant and that I do not like; moreover, I would say that I am inclined to hate him.
Ah! you're trying to escape, vile creature! you're trying to escape like a thief, in the middle of the night, eh?
Adele watched her friend with dismay. Large tears flooded her face, she could not suppress this scream of anguish and pity: "Oh! Mary! poor Mary!".
Mary was sleeping; she was still wearing her torn white dress, and her long black hair, resting in a dishevelled manner upon her shoulders, contrasted strongly with the paleness of her face.
Tom was a wonderful boy, who had gained the affection and esteem of all.
You men, you're all selfish and heartless, and us women, who are always loving and compassionate, we're forced to obey you!
Tom reluctantly let Mary into his house.
You're starting to annoy me.
Tom was annoyed at the interruption.
Tom seems more annoyed than angry.
Tom seems really annoyed.
Tom seems uncomfortable and annoyed.
Tom slammed the door shut just to annoy Mary.
Tom had an annoyed look on his face.
You're really on time.
It’s just midnight.
Thanks for being on time.
Tell them to hurry up.
I think I hear them.
Has this thing appeared again tonight?
It's all in your imagination.
Tom says it's all in our imagination.
It's so annoying!
Tie him to a tree.
Whip him until he confesses.
She was convinced that Pierre knew more than he wanted to confess.
We should talk calmly to each other.
It reminds me of a certain someone...
He reminds me of somebody.
She reminds me of someone.
I don't know which child is yours.
I don’t know what her intentions are.
Who is able to explain this to me?
I can explain what’s on the grapevine.
Do you know how it feels to translate a hundred similar variations of a sentence?
Thus we were urged into a fight.
He has gathered an army of lawless criminals.
He has gathered a small army of volunteers.
I think it can be no other reason but that.
She wants something very special for her birthday.
Ah! how polite and gallant men are when they're trying to obtain something from a poor woman!
"Murder!", screamed the poor woman in a loud shriek.
And those were her last words.
And those were his last words.
How am I supposed to know where she's hiding her money?
We must absolutely find the assassins.
You are loved and missed throughout the world, man.
I must give my respects.
Does your language have a word for "exobiology"?
Seize this brigand! Prevent him from escaping!
Don't mention the war!
The city of Rome is famous.
Did you have a pleasant trip?
I love your daughter.
I love her daughter.
I love his daughter.
I love your son.
I love her son.
I love his son.
Tom is an art dealer.
Does your father know?
Does your mother know?
What time is your train?
What time is your plane?
What time is your bus?
Well, that was quick!
He came too fast.
He came really fast.
He came quickly.
The young man came running to meet her.
It took less than five minutes.
It took less than five minutes for me to write that letter.
It took slightly more than five minutes for Tom to read the pamphlet.
We only use 10% of our brain.
I love Tom.
How could it be?
How can it be?
How long has he been dead?
How bad can it be?
Harry is a wizard.
Harry put on his robe and wizard hat.
It's simpler and more reliable.
This car is more reliable than a Lada.

I taught my girlfriend how to drive.
I taught my sister how to drive.
I taught Tom how to drive.
She taught me how to drive.
It was an eye-opening experience.

This car has a good warranty.
"Tom will be here soon." "How soon?"
"Will you buy it for me?" "Buy what?"
"Everybody is invited." "Even Tom?"
"Please go there now." "Go where?"
Did she say something?
Did he say something?
"Why did Tom do that?" "Beats me."
"Why did Tom do that?" "I have no idea."
"Why did Tom do that?" "I don't know."
"Why did Tom do that?" "Do what?"
She's intelligent and sexy.
He's sexy and intelligent.

Tom says that he's too busy to help Mary today.
He wants to talk to you.

Think of your family.
I have problems with my wife, too.
Do you want to look at it?
Does he want to look at it?
Does she want to look at it?
There's something I have to tell you.
The fugitive crossed the river.
He's going to cross the river.
I can't take this any longer.
She couldn't take it any longer.
He couldn't take it any longer.
You can't go in there!
I can't take it any longer.
He's a southpaw.
Sadly, Tom doesn't read books.
Wake up Tom.
Don't mess with me!
Don't mess with me, Tom!
Truer words have never been spoken.
I think I can prove it.
He thinks he can prove it.
She thinks she can prove it.
You're such a liar.
He's no saint.
She's no saint.
I'm no saint.

She is no saint.
She wished she had more time.
He wished he had more time.
He wished she had more time.
He came to pick me up.

This is not a shortcut; this is private property.
Just a little bit.
Tom spent all morning in the interrogation room.
The policeman aimed his gun at Tom and yelled, "Hold it right there!"
I will buy a car next month.
This box is very heavy.
"Would you like me to put some cream in your coffee?" "Yes, just a little bit."
Tom does not know the difference between a diamond and an emerald.
She was banished for life.

I ate chicken nuggets.
Mary had not suspected that the young farmer liked her; she loved him as a brother.
I understand everything now and I regret that Tom is not here with me now.
"What happened to you, Mary?" asked Tom while carrying the poor crazy woman to the back.
Georgina bit her lips until they bled.
It's now the season when cheetahs like to chase after herds of deer and when wild turkeys gather into rafters and go cluck together.
This man's behaviour is mysterious and suspect.
She opened the door and invited the young farmer in.
You're white as a ghost. Are you sick?
She had killed her first husband with the help of the second one. They had done it with a nail that they pushed together into his temples while he was sleeping.
Poetry has no other goal than itself.
The beautiful is always strange.
Tom planted three apple trees and a peach tree in his yard.
Peach trees require lots of sunshine.
I accept, but only on one condition.
Mary is left-handed.
Twins are clones.
This is a good question.
I encourage my brother.
Every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living.
Every man has a right to his own property.
We must build toward the time when a major depression cannot occur again; and if this means sacrificing the easy profits of inflationist booms, then let them go; and good riddance.
Democracy is a quest, a never-ending seeking for better things, and in the seeking for these things and the striving for better things, and in the seeking for these things and the striving for them, there are many roads to follow.
Some of my friends tell me that they do not want the Government in business. With this I agree; but I wonder whether they realize the implications of the past. For while it has been American doctrine that the government must not go into business in competition with private enterprises, still it has been traditional particularly in Republican administrations for business urgently to ask the government to put at private disposal all kinds of government assistance.
The same man who tells you that he does not want to see the government interfere in business—and he means it, and has plenty of good reasons for saying so—is the first to go to Washington and ask the government for a prohibitory tariff on his product.
A glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have know it no longer exists.
It still is true that men can start small enterprises, trusting to native shrewdness and ability to keep abreast of competitors; but area after area has been preempted altogether by the great corporations, and even in the fields which still have no great concerns, the small man starts with a handicap.
Put plainly, we are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already.
I am very sorry you have a cold and are in bed. I played with Mary today for a little while. I hope by tomorrow you will be able to be up. I am glad today that my cold is better.
Mr. Esperanto is well, isn't he?
Where is the person that wants to eat shaved ice?
If you eat a lot, you'll eventually get fat.

There is no such thing, at this stage of the world’s history in The United States of America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it. There is not one of you who dare write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinions out of the paper I am connected with. Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone. The business of the journalist is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of Mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press? We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.

As you contribute more sentences to the Tatoeba Corpus in your native language, the percentage of sentences in your native language with errors will likely decrease.

Therefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince, and discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are spoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are remarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or praise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly, using a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is still he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly who deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed generous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless, another faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave; one affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one sincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another frivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like.

These don't match.
They arrested me.
They believe me.
They built it.
They called you.
They felt menaced.
They have escaped.
They have families.
They have information.
They jumped me.
They missed us.
They want this.
They wanted me.
They won't budge.
They won't know.
They won't stop.
They won't talk.
They'll come back.
They'll never succeed.
They'll never understand.
They'll rescue us.
They'll suspect me.
They're absolutely certain.
They're all gone.
They're all safe.
They're always wrong.
They're being evacuated.
They're coming now.
They're going crazy.
They're grown men.
They're ignoring us.
They're in here.
They're not prisoners.
They're not suspicious.
They're playing cards.
They're sending help.
Is it true that Tom has a twin?
One word is enough for a wise man.
We acted in good faith.
I've lost faith in you.
There was a sudden drop in the temperature last night.
I don't know what his faith is.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
She reads nothing but fiction.
Few people realize it, but it's true.
I only know a few words.
Quite a few people are coming around to that way of thinking.
Is that story fact or fiction?
The fish in this river are few and far between.
I won't play second fiddle for anyone.
Let's cut across this field.
The teams are coming onto the field.
He's the best man in his field.
This writer spent several years in the field with the troops.
He gave me a fierce look.
How can you stand that fierce heat all day?
You're going to come up against fierce competition.
This bottle holds a fifth of a gallon.
He's the fifth man in line.
He's in his fifties.
Let's not start a fight.
Everybody suspected him of bribery.
We put up a good fight but we lost.
He hasn't got any fight left in him.
I can't make out these figures.
She has a nice figure.
He's one of the most important figures in modern literature.
How do you like this bronze figure I picked up in my travels?
Figure seven shows all the parts of the motor.
I figure it's about time we're going.
This didn't figure in my plans.
That's something I hadn't figured on.
Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.
Can you figure out this problem?
Figure up how much it amounts to.
Where should I file this correspondence?
I'll have time to file my nails while you're dressing.
I don't like modern films.
Do you have any film for this camera?
They filmed the entire ceremony.
How did you make out on your French finals?
This salve will act as a protective film over the burn.
He was eliminated before he got to the finals.
I don't want you to go alone; this is final.
Is that your final decision?
The country is in ruins, yet still there are mountains and rivers.
Can you find your way all right?
If he's convicted he'll have to pay a fine.
I finally found out where you were last night.
This pen has a very fine point.
Grind this coffee very fine.
There's no need of making such fine distinctions.
That was a mighty fine thing for him to do.
That's a fine way to treat a friend.
It's a fine day today.
I'm feeling fine, thanks.
The judge fined him five dollars.
He was given the finest education that money could buy.
That's fine!
I cut my finger peeling potatoes.
I know I have it, but I can't put my finger on it.
Were you there to see the finish?
This table has a nice finish.
Let's finish this job tonight.
Wait until I finish eating.
Will you light the fire?
That man was fired last week.
There was a big fire in the store.
The chimney caught on fire and the house burned down.
Wait until they open fire.
Better be careful, you're playing with fire.
That was no accident; someone set the house on fire.
Fire away!
How much fire insurance do you have?
Whose firm do you represent?
He has very firm convictions.
Do you remember the first time I came here?
He's always the first to complain.
The first good rain storm will wash it away.
I have to go to the store first.
First, let me ask you this.
The trees were torn up by the force of the storm.
We had to take him by force.
Which branch of the armed forces were you in?
The door has been forced.
We were forced to change our tactics.
We forced him to admit that he'd done it.
The plane made a forced landing.
He studied at a foreign university.
He has a prejudice against foreigners.
I'm afraid I'll be stuck in this place forever.
He's forever telling the same story.
It's raining, and we forgot to close the windows.
She's forgotten how to do it.
Could I have a knife and fork, please?
Turn left when you get to the fork in the road.
Is this a different word or just another form of the same word?
I play tennis, but my form is terrible.
You didn't finish filling out this form.
I haven't formed an opinion on that subject yet.
We had to attend just as a matter of form.
He's quite formal when he meets a stranger.
Did you make a formal agreement with him?
Of your two suggestions, I think I prefer the former.
He's a former student of mine.
He's a former president of the country.
He kept walking back and forth.
Six men came forward to volunteer for the work.
He was visiting his foster mother.
They did everything they could to foster good relations.
It was a foul play.
The air in here is foul.
That man has a foul mouth.
He was awarded a scholarship to do research for the foundation.
Three-fourths of the people of this town don't vote.
The foundation of this house is beginning to weaken.
The fracture wasn't as serious as we thought.
The boy fell off the bicycle and fractured his skull.
The frame of the house should be finished in a day or two.
I bought a leather frame for the picture.
I'd prefer a plain frame on these glasses.
He has a heavy frame.
They framed a constitution for the club.
Have you framed those pictures I brought in last week?
It's best not to leave her alone in that frame of mind.
He was framed on a murder charge.
You're free of all responsibility.
I don't have any free time today.
This is a free sample.
They held him for a few hours and then let him go free.
He wants us to free the prisoners.
When will he be freed?
Will you give me a free hand in the matter?
The game ended in a free-for-all.
The product is guaranteed to be free from defects.
That doesn't leave me much freedom of action.
Do you think the pond is frozen hard enough to skate on?
My feet are freezing.
He froze with fear when he saw the snake.
The cold froze the water in the pipes.
All funds are frozen until further notice.
I'm stuck in my job.
How much freight did you carry last trip?
How much is the freight on this box?
Do you like French wine?
I prefer the flavor of fresh-water fish.
I did my best to make friends with him.
He has a very friendly smile.
Our country has always had friendly relations with yours.
I just came from my house.
Take a clean glass from the cupboard.
Take a book from the shelf.
I live ten miles from the city.
Can you tell him from his brother?
I won't take such insults from anybody.
He was tired and nervous from overwork.
From what he says, I don't think we should go.
I saw it from the window.
From his point of view he's right.
He kept me from making a big mistake.
The front of the house is painted white.
He was at the front for three months.
Someone's at the front door.
My friend frowned as she read the letter.
The whole family frowned on the match.
Sometime I'll definitely visit France. I just don't know exactly when.
Give me a full glass of water.
I walked until my legs felt tired.
I'm so full I can't eat any more.
Humans are the only animals that can use fire.
That book is full of mistakes.
The dress has a full skirt.
Linda visited someone and still hasn't come back.
I don't see any fun in it.
We were just having a little fun.
That's not a very funny story.
I have a funny feeling.
We'll furnish you with everything you need.
How have you furnished your apartment?
Do you want to study it further?
The short circuit blew a fuse.
Who was that sitting in front of you at the movies?
Try to do better in the future.
This job has no future.
Introduce me to your future wife.
The bandits put a gag in his mouth.
Is this a gag?
We found him bound and gagged.
The invalid gagged on the heavy food.
Their loss is our gain.
There's been a recent gain in the population of the city.
My watch gains ten minutes a day.
His sincerity gained the confidence of everyone.
We have seats in the gallery.
We walked through a long gallery.
Give me five gallons of gas, please.
Don't gamble with other people's money.
He loves to gamble but generally loses.
He's gambling everything on the success of his son.
He looks upon his work as a game.
I saw through his game.
Is there any big game near here?
How long have you been in this game?
I'm game for anything.
He plays a good game.
The gangsters of the city were organized in gangs.
These flowers are from our garden.
I want to plant a vegetable garden.
Let's stop at the next station and gas up.
The crowd poured out through the gate.
He gathered up his things and left.
The crowd gathered around the speaker.
I gather you don't like him.
The car slowly gathered speed.
The sleeves are gathered at the cuff.
Is there an air gauge here?
Is there an air pressure gauge here?
Gauges are used to measure the thickness of wire.
The wind must be gauged accurately.
Be careful or you'll strip the gears.
We spent the afternoon cleaning our gear.
They're still around.
They're still available.
They're surrounding us.
They're under arrest.
They've found survivors.
They've got explosives.
They've got guns.
Things are changing.
Things are fine.
Things are normal.
Things are quieter.
Things are tense.
Things got heated.
Things got violent.
Things got worse.
Things happened fast.
Things look good.
Think about that.
Think about them.
Think about this.
Think about tomorrow.
Think for yourself.
Think happy thoughts.
This changes things.
This disturbs me.
This doesn't count.
This doesn't help.
This doesn't work.
This door's locked.
This drawer's stuck.
This explains everything.
This feels good.
This feels right.
This feels weird.
This guy's good.
This guy's tough.
This happened before.
This is humiliating.

This one's empty.
This one's free.
This one's great.
This one's mine.
This one's OK.
This really helped.

This shouldn't happen.
This sounds good.
This sounds healthy.
This sounds interesting.
This sounds reasonable.
This stuff works.
This stuff's awful.
This stuff's irreplaceable.
This stuff's radioactive.
This was fun.
This was good.
This was great.
This was unexpected.
This will do.
This will help.
This will work.
This won't do.
This won't help.
This won't wait.

This'll be different.
This'll be fun.

Throw them away.
Today's your birthday.

In general, things are all right.

War's not pretty.
Was everything satisfactory?

Was it thrilling?
Was that helpful?
Wash the car.
Wash the dishes.
Wasn't that fantastic?
Wasn't that fun?
Watch and learn.
Watch me now.
Watch the door.
Watch the prisoner.
Watch them closely.
Watch your head.
Watch your mouth.
We'll do something.
We'll get caught.
They hold a general election every year.
Be generous; don't think only of his faults.
I moved into a new apartment.
He's certainly generous with his money.
This restaurant serves generous portions.
The nurse has very gentle hands.
There was a gentle knock on the door.
He was rowing against a gentle current.
Isn't he a gentle person?
Don't work too much!
The attempt failed.
That dog is very gentle.
This way, gentlemen!
He made a gesture with his hand.
His work was merely a gesture of good will.
He gestures when he speaks.
When did you get my letter?
Can you get me another pencil?
Can you get him to come to the theater?
They got him elected Mayor.
We've got enough.
I'll get there in an hour.
I'll go and get the book tomorrow.
I couldn't get him by phone.
Wait till I get my hat.
For an old man he gets about very well.
Finally I was able to get the meaning across.
Those two don't get along.
I'll get along somehow.
It's late and I'll have to be getting along.
He's certainly getting along in years.
He gets around a lot.
The story will get around in a few hours.
Can you get around that regulation?
She gets around him.
I can't get at my luggage.
Some day I'll get at the real reason.
I want to get away from the noise.
I'm sure I can get away with it.
How can I get back at him?
Can I get by the guard?
Do you think I can get by with it?
I'll get by if I have a place to sleep.
I'll get fired if they find out.
He'll be able to get the work going.
What time does the train get in?
Please get the clothes in before it rains.
Get in touch with me.
Did you get in with our crowd?
I can't get my shoes off.
Please get off the couch.
I'll get off with very light punishment.
He's getting old.
Don't get on the train yet.
Let's get on with the meeting.
How are you getting on?
The three of us get on very well.
He can't even write his own name.
We mustn't let this news get out.
How much did you get out of the deal?
How did you ever get out of it?
I got over my cold quickly.
How did you get over the difficulty?
When are you going to get dinner ready?
Get it out of the house.
They got to be good friends.
Let's get together tonight at my house.
They never seem to get together on anything.
I get up at seven every morning.
I don't want to get my feet wet.
He got off to a flying start.
Do you get the idea?
I got angry.
We've got to leave early.
I worked a bit at my computer.
All my clothes have gotten dirty since I've been here.
There will be a giant crop of corn this year.
Thank you for the Christmas gift.
He has a gift for drawing.
The woman gave birth to a baby girl.
Are there any pretty girls in town?
Is there a TV in your bedroom?
Why do you like Hawaii?
Fly, thought, on wings of gold; // go settle upon the slopes and the hills, // where, soft and mild, the sweet airs // of our native land smell fragrant!
Well, girls, it's time to go.
I just got a letter from my girl.
Please give me the letter.
Who's giving the main speech?
Be careful! The step might give under your weight!
I don't give a damn.
I gave my old clothes away.
Don't give away my secret.
Please give me back my pen.
After a long argument, I finally gave in.
The flowers give off a strong odor.
Who gave out the tickets?
Our supplies are running out.
The maid gave up her job.
I tried hard, but I had to give up.
There's a river near my house.
After their quarrel, she called it quits.
He was so ill, the doctor gave up on him.
The bridge gave way.
The crowd gave way.
Who gave away the bride?
This elastic has a lot of give.
I must finish in a given time.
Given such a situation what else could I do?
He is given to lying.
I'm glad to hear you're better.
I recognized him at a glance.
The bullet glanced off his helmet.
We'll save you.
We'll show Tom.
We'll talk tonight.
We've done nothing.
We've got everything.
We've got nothing.
We've lost them.
We've made it.

The sleigh glided swiftly over the ice.
Look how the plane is gliding toward the field!
I'm a restaurant manager.
The glitter of the sun hurts my eyes.
Water glitters in the sunlight.
It's a very gloomy day.
Why are you so gloomy?
Don't be so gloomy about the future.
Our country has a glorious history.
This is certainly a glorious day.

The shopkeeper let this cloth go for almost nothing.
Can I try on this jumper, please?
Whatever he says goes.
When you start to swim, go like this.
Let him go hungry.
Everything goes wrong when I leave.
I'll go crazy if this keeps up.
The prize will go to the best student.
In Spain they speak Spanish.
You were at home yesterday.
