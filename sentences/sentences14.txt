Anne go to your room and stay there until I come up.
Her temper matches her hair I guess.
Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and hearing other people say it.
It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that, Anne.
"Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that you were skinny and ugly," pleaded Anne tearfully.
Oh, no, I'm not vexed—don't worry yourself. I'm too sorry for you to leave any room for anger in my mind.
You must go to her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her to forgive you.
"I can never do that," said Anne determinedly and darkly. "You can punish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark, damp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and water and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive me."
I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her. How can I? I'm not sorry.
It's a good thing Rachel Lynde got a calling down; she's a meddlesome old gossip.
She's a meddlesome old gossip.
I reckon she ought to be punished a little. But don't be too hard on her, Marilla.
He had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he helped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.
Anne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out into the garden.
Don't you think you'd better do it and have it over with?
It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know.
I'm sorry I lost my temper and said rude things.
I'm a dreadfully wicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out by respectable people forever.
Run along, child.
She certainly is an odd child.
Anne came out of the fragrant twilight of the orchard with a sheaf of white narcissi in her hands.
I hope you'll try to control your temper now, Anne.
You shouldn't think so much about your looks, Anne. I'm afraid you are a very vain little girl.
Aren't the stars bright tonight?
If you could live in a star, which one would you pick? I'd like that lovely clear big one away over there above that dark hill.
If you could live in a star, which one would you pick?
It's lovely to be going home and know it's home.
I love Green Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever seemed like home.
"Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying," said Anne meditatively.
Anne was standing in the gable room, looking solemnly at three new dresses spread out on the bed.
Oh, I can see you don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them?
Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill, Marilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.
I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and sensible all by myself.
Don't stare at people and don't fidget.
They looked at her and whispered to each other behind their quarterlies.
Miss Rogerson was a middle-aged lady who had taught a Sunday-school class for twenty years.
Every other little girl in the class had puffed sleeves. Anne felt that life was really not worth living without puffed sleeves.
Well, how did you like Sunday school?
I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.
The sermon was awfully long.
You'd better not let Tom see you do that.
How do you make a living?
Tom has just finished his work.
Do you have any idea who actually wrote this letter?
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to take out the garbage.
How do you think that this situation should be resolved?
I think Tom was in shock.
I need someplace to hide.
Why do you let Tom treat you that way?
How far is it to the zoo?
Tom has made the baseball team.
You aren't really going to sing that song, are you?
I don't think Tom will ever be able to sing as well as Mary.
How long do you think it'll take you to accomplish that?
Let Tom do what he wants.
I was definitely worried.
We need to find Tom as quickly as we can.
How long can I stay here?
Tom has never flown in a plane.
Why didn't you tell me you'd already paid the bill?
The meeting was awfully long.
The meeting was very long.
I hope you'll try to control your temper from now on.
Tom certainly is an odd kid.
Tom certainly is a strange kid.
Tom certainly is a talented kid.
Can I go?
Guess again.
Tom sniffed.
I must do it.
I teased Tom.
I suggested it.
It isn't heavy.
I feel very sad.
It's past eight.
Give me your bag.
It's so pathetic.
I feel so excited.
Isn't that pretty?
Tom lent it to me.
Well, what's next?
I insist upon that.
I must go home now.
I've been insulted.
Tom was a nice boy.
Where are the oars?
Can't we be friends?
I'll try to be good.
I think Tom likes it.
I'll do my very best.
I'm ready to confess.
Tom is a famous cook.
Tom is too outspoken.
Tom won't forgive me.
You're so kind to me.
Am I talking too much?
Everything was lovely.
How did the others do?
I guess you're hungry.
Tom's ankle is broken.
Begin at the beginning.
I didn't like it a bit.
I liked it pretty well.
I'll do all the chores.
Tom is a real good man.
Tom's mind was made up.
Doesn't Mary look lovely?
Excuse me a minute, Tom.
I can't stay here alone.
I made so many mistakes.
They're always laughing.
Tom was such an odd boy.
We'll never forget this.
What spices did you use?
Why didn't anybody come?
I asked Tom all about it.
I don't speak to Tom now.
I hope I didn't hurt Tom.
I hope you appreciate it.
I was born in that house.
I'd love to be a teacher.
Isn't that too expensive?
Let me tell you my plans.
That was why I confessed.
Tom looked rather scared.
Tom told me you did that.
I never noticed it before.
Tell me the truth at once.
Tom was talking about you.
I can't go to school today.
It's tremendously exciting.
Tom looked rather relieved.
What flavoring did you use?
What would you advise, Tom?
Why don't you like it here?
I felt so ashamed of myself.
I hope you were a good girl.
I'm really glad you like it.
It's a kind of pretty place.
One of the doors was broken.
Tom is a very religious man.
Tom's hair isn't red, is it?
I guess I'll have to do that.
Is Tom going to school today?
It was a very lonesome place.
Has Tom eaten anything at all?
I heard Tom playing the piano.
Don't you worry about me a bit.
What on earth did you give Tom?
Would you rather I didn't help?
Would you rather I didn't stay?
Would you rather I didn't talk?
Would you like to be an elephant?
Would you rather I didn't leave?
I wrote that last Monday evening.
I don't want to get there too soon.
I knew you couldn't guess the answer.
I wouldn't have dyed my hair that color.
Tom asked me if I knew anyone who spoke French.
Don't fidget.
Wash your face
Comb your hair.
Did you touch it?
We're nearly home.
Take off your boots.
Tom is awfully sick.
I wish I had dimples.
It was our own fault.
I guess once is enough.
I'll be back next year.
I'll get up at sunrise.
Tom says you're bright.
I didn't mean to meddle.
I know I'll be punished.
I suppose I'd better go.
I'm glad Tom liked them.
I'm such an unlucky guy.
I forgot to ask Tom that.
I know just how Tom felt.
Tom made me promise that.
Don't you know who Tom is?
I feel tempted to do that.
I have it all planned out.
I knew you could beat Tom.
That was a thrilling book.
Tom has a very bad temper.
Tom nearly fell overboard.
I know Tom will be furious.
It's extremely interesting.
Tom is a very generous man.
Tom is such a sensible man.
Tomorrow is Tom's birthday.
My mind is quite made up.
I think that's all nonsense.
I'm so glad it's warm today.
They always made us do that.
Tom asked no more questions.
I've been crying like a baby.
It was Tom's idea to do that.
Tom came home this afternoon.
Tom is a very particular man.
I answered a lot of questions.
I didn't let Tom in the house.
I hope you didn't disturb Tom.
I know we can help each other.
I was so tired I couldn't eat.
I wish I didn't have to leave.
Please excuse me for a minute.
What've you done to your hair?
Have tea ready when I get back.
How on earth did you get there?
I think I've sprained my ankle.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I'm going to Boston in October.
Tom didn't say much about that.
You don't know how tired I was.
Can you tell me why that's true?
Have tea ready when I come back.
I know I'll have to be punished.
I know you'll tell me the truth.
I love a book that makes me cry.
I never expected Tom to do that.
I suppose you'd like to see Tom.
I think I did fairly well today.
I wish I didn't have to do that.
I'll just talk it over with Tom.
That's what I was trying to say.
Tom is good at asking questions.
Tom looked dubious for a moment.
Tom must be a great help to you.
Tom, what's the matter with you?
Why was Tom here this afternoon?
Can you tell me why you think so?
I don't mind being beaten by Tom.
I knew you could beat Tom easily.
I'll try not to think about that.
It was stupid to do such a thing.
Please tell me why you're crying.
That's a very comforting thought.
Tom opened the box and peeped in.
What time did I tell you to come?
Who was that you were talking to?
Why do people kneel down to pray?
Tom has been a faithful friend.
Are you going to apologize to Tom?
Can you tell me why that happened?
I was mistaken and I'm glad I was.
I've grown two inches this summer.
The sermon was awfully long today.
Tom wouldn't speak to Mary at all.
Were we really there half an hour?
Do I really look the same as usual?
I don't know what else can be done.
I had a headache all day yesterday.
I wish I had something to give Tom.
If Tom isn't your name, what is it?
Please excuse me for just a minute.
Please excuse me for just a moment.
Tom is such a sympathetic listener.
Let me hear what you have to say.
Don't answer me back like that, Tom.
Everyone says Tom will win the race.
I don't know what on earth you mean.
I never make the same mistake twice.
Is there a river anywhere near here?
There's plenty of food in the house.
I don't approve of such goings-on.
I'm sure I know just how Tom felt.
Do you honestly think we can do this?
How dare you call me skinny and ugly?
I can just imagine myself doing that.
I'll never be able to live this down.
What time did I tell you to get here?
Wouldn't it be nice if they did that?
You'd better let Tom do that for you.
That has been my experience anyhow.
That's something I won't encourage.
Are we going to be friends after this?
Dreams don't often come true, do they?
Everybody has forgot about me and Tom.
Everybody says Tom will win the prize.
I knew Tom was up to some foolishness.
I wish I didn't have to leave so soon.
Puffed sleeves are so fashionable now.
Take off your boots now and go to bed.
Tom didn't think he needed a new coat.
Tom looked as if he were ready to cry.
You'll go to school tomorrow as usual.
Do you think you'll be able to do that?
I had no real idea what it looked like.
I want to tell you about what happened.
Let me introduce you two to each other.
Neither of them knew what to say or do.
Our potato crop is very good this year.
Tom cried all the way home from school.
Tom is going to lend me a book to read.
I haven't yet read the book Tom lent me.
I'd like to know why you didn't obey me.
I'm afraid you've been working too hard.
It all depends on the way we look at it.
People are always telling me to do that.
Tom got awfully sick and had to go home.
Tom needs your help much more than I do.
Tom was afraid Mary wouldn't notice him.
Were we really there for thirty minutes?
Where were you born and how old are you?
I'm extremely grateful to you and Tom.
I don't ever expect to be a bride myself.
I don't think we can do anything for Tom.
I just laughed because everyone else did.
I've been thinking about you all morning.
If I were a man, I think I'd be a priest.
Isn't that something to be proud of, Tom?
Sit down here and tell me about yourself.
There's no use trying to reason with Tom.
Tom wasn't dressed like the other boys.
Can you tell me why you think that's true?
I need to think of something funny to say.
Tom looks lonely and sad, don't you think?
Will your parents let you stay home today?
You're so much more dignified than I am.
Do you suppose it will make any difference?
I don't think we can do anything right now.
I know we can help each other in many ways.
I wish my imagination was as good as yours.
It's worse than anything you could imagine.
Suppose Tom wasn't really going to do that.
I don't think we can do anything about that.
I thought nothing could be as bad as cancer.
It was very silly of you to do such a thing.
Wouldn't it be nice if they did that for us?
I can't tell you what a thrill it gave me.
I couldn't help fearing I'd only imagined it.
I wouldn't forgive Tom even if he apologized.
It does really seem as if I must be dreaming.
Perhaps Tom will think I tried to poison him.
The less fuss made the better, in my opinion.
I'm sure it must have been very disturbing.
Tom can't be much different from ourselves.
I couldn't love anybody as much as I love you.
I might've known nobody really wanted me here.
Tom has something very important to tell Mary.
I knew things were going too smooth to last.
I can't do this, so please don't ask me to try.
I wish I didn't have to go to Boston next week.
Tom opened his eyes and looked around the room.
I'll try not to think about what might go wrong.
We want to hire someone to help Tom on the farm.
I don't like children who ask a lot of questions.
I'd like to know why you didn't just wait for Tom.
I'm better at looking after children than you are.
Tom certainly needs your help much more than I do.
Tom wants to rent our farm for the next few years.
I suppose I'd better go and talk to Tom about that.
People are always telling me I have beautiful eyes.
Tom wanted to know when Mary was going to come home.
Wouldn't it be nice if this warm weather could last?
The only reason I laughed was because everyone else did.
You don't know what you're getting for Christmas, do you?
I'd like to know why you didn't do what I asked you to do.
People are always telling me that I speak French very well.
Life was certainly very interesting when we lived in Boston.
I'll try not to think about everything that needs to be done.
I've been so happy.
I've been here for a year.
I do hope you won't be offended.
Baseball season hasn't begun yet.
I'm glad you've come to live with us.
I guess I was a little too hard on you.
It wasn't as hard as you might imagine.
I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair.
These headaches of mine are getting worse.
It'll be fun to have somebody to play with.
Next Monday would be a good time to do that.
You won't keep me from doing that, will you?
For a moment, I couldn't remember where I was.
I saw Tom pick it up and put it in his pocket.
There's something I don't understand about Tom.
Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself.
You're not going to the picnic and that's final.
We've decided to give you the loan you requested.
Don't you think that's a very strange coincidence?
I'm really very healthy even though I'm very thin.
Next Monday would be a good time for you to visit.
I actually thought Tom was going to choke to death.
These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse.
I've been expecting something like this to happen for some time.
I've been expecting something like this to happen for a long time.
It's kind of you, Fadil.
You mean you spent the entire morning with Jamal?
Don't exaggerate, Jamal.
How old are you really? Don't lie to me.
Alright. Let's see what we can do.
I need permission from your parents or guardian.
Come and have some.
Here's some ice.
You're all wet.
Pass the salt please.
"I didn't go to my classes." "How come?"
Where did you get to?
She lives on the outskirts of the city.
You look you've just returned from a safari in the savannah.
I'd rather die than do something like this.
I got very thirsty.
We found a stream and swam a little bit.
Why didn't you invite him in?
Were they really good-looking?
Did you ask him his number?
The only thing everybody here wants is for you to find someone you'd be happy with.
"I love you." "I love you, too."
He didn't give us his previous employment record.
Would that be difficult?
When does he get back?
In one month, you'll have to give me your guardian's authorization, otherwise, we'll not keep you.
She's on probation for the moment.
You're still in your probation period.
She's new here. Please show her around.
He looks like a gangster.
I'm a little behind with my work.
Your fiancee was looking for you.
I'm waiting for a phone call from that friend of mine.
Would you take a look at this beautiful baby?
I thought you would never call me.
She didn't like coffee.
I'll get outside.
I can't hear you well. I'll get outside.
You call me if anything else happens.
What did you tell your friend?
I'll go over and see her.
Don't bother yourself.
Tom couldn't afford to pay for his mother's funeral.
Tom isn't exactly a model student.
I don't know anyone here, except for Tom.
What you said earlier at that table really moved me.
I'll give you the anesthetic.
It's not gonna hurt.
You can't leave like this.
You can take off the bandage tomorrow.
What type of work does Tom do?
What kind of work does Tom do?
I don't have much experience driving on the right side of the road.
Stop interrupting me.
I've had a crush on you since the first time I met you.
I should've paid more attention in school.
I should've been paying more attention in class.
I should've paid more attention in class
Tom was here a few minutes ago.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
Tom says that he wasn't surprised at all.
This restaurant has a romantic atmosphere.
Tom would be furious if he knew what you did.
Advertising campaigns have shaped popular culture, and launched brand into the public eye
We're not going to lose.
I'm not responsible for what Tom has done.
Stop wasting time.
Tom invited me to stay at his place in Boston for spring break.
Tom says he won't stay.
I don't mind doing that.
I don't want any dinner.
I'll never come back here.
Tom tried to talk to Mary.
Can you wash dishes tonight?
I don't want anything to eat.
You shouldn't talk about Tom.
Did you hear what I said, Tom?
I love Tom with my whole heart.
Tom tells me you have a garden.
I think you ought to let Tom go.
Mary is having a new dress made.
I'm not coming back here anymore.
I'll tell Tom as soon as he comes.
Tom will never believe what I did.
I think you ought to let Tom leave.
Tom isn't where I told him to wait.
What can I do for you this evening?
It wasn't a particularly good movie.
Take those flowers out of your hair.
I didn't think anybody could do that.
Tom is only three years older than us.
In my opinion, you ought to let Tom go.
Don't tell Tom I said anything about it.
Tom almost wished he had never met Mary.
Tom stayed with the Jacksons that night.
I'm very glad you feel the same way I do.
When I got there, Tom met me at the door.
Why are you taking all those things home?
I think you ought to let Tom go home early.
My opinion is that you ought to let Tom go.
I'll go over to Tom's early tomorrow morning.
I think you ought to let Tom do what he wants.
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep a wink.
What are you taking all those things home for?
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom.
Where was Tom going and why was he going there?
Do you suppose we'll ever be asked to do that?
Tom will never believe that I did it on purpose.
Tom says we can have all the apples on this tree.
I wonder how Tom and Mary are enjoying themselves.
Do you think there's any chance of that happening?
Tom is staying at the same hotel where I'm staying.
Do you remember what happened on this day last year?
Tom looks a lot like his father did at the same age.
Tom softly closed the door and tiptoed over to Mary.
For a moment, it looked as if Tom might start crying.
I think you ought to let Tom go to Boston by himself.
Tom's birthday is in October and mine is in November.
I guess you're going to do that no matter what we say.
I forgot to tell Tom to take the cookies out of the oven.
It's not the first time Tom has done something like that.
I hope you'll try to control your temper better next time.
Do you remember what happened last summer when we tried doing this?
I don't think Tom is going to want to go to Boston with you.
How could you agree to doing that without consulting me?
Tell Tom to quit singing.
I don't know what you did.
Tom will sing one of the songs you wrote.
How long was your flight?
Tom has other responsibilities.
What's it going to take to convince you to help us?
How could Tom and Mary possibly have anything to do with it?
How could anyone in their right mind disagree with this?
The hospital has three wings.
Tom's desk is next to Mary's.
"Do you like me?" "To be honest, I hate your guts. No offence." "None taken."
Tom and Mary both glanced at John.
I'm learning Aramaic.
I am learning Aramaic.
Anne, Mrs. Rachel says you went to church last Sunday with your hat rigged out ridiculous with roses and buttercups.
Don't answer me back like that, Anne.
Never let me catch you at such a trick again.
"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Anne, tears welling into her eyes. "I never thought you'd mind."
This is completely counter-productive.
She had the reputation of being very strict with her children.
She was a very pretty little girl, with her mother's black eyes and hair.
"This is my little girl Diana," said Mrs. Barry.
Diana, you might take Anne out into the garden and show her your flowers.
She reads entirely too much.
She's always poring over a book.
The garden was encircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished flowers that loved the shade.
Diana laughed. Diana always laughed before she spoke.
I'm awfully glad you've come to live at Green Gables.
It will be jolly to have somebody to play with. There isn't any other girl who lives near enough to play with, and I've no sisters big enough.
"Will you swear to be my friend forever and ever?" demanded Anne eagerly.
Diana looked shocked.
Oh Marilla, I'm the happiest girl on Prince Edward Island this very moment.
It's only three weeks since she came, and it seems as if she'd been here always.
I've never been to a picnic.
I'd like to know why you didn't obey me, Anne.
When I tell you to come in at a certain time I mean that time and not half an hour later.
Anne cast herself into Marilla's arms and rapturously kissed her sallow cheek.
Tom is a border patrol agent.
Now, get out your patchwork and have your square done before teatime.
"I do not like patchwork," said Anne dolefully, hunting out her workbasket and sitting down before a little heap of red and white diamonds with a sigh.
Tom has been working at the same factory for 25 years.
Tom really likes his job.
Mary really likes her job.
I'm afraid there'll be a great many disappointments in store for you through life.
Looking forward to things is half the pleasure of them.
Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed.
Mrs. Lynde says, 'Blessed are they who expect nothing for they shall not be disappointed.' But I think it would be worse to expect nothing than to be disappointed.
Marilla always wore her amethyst brooch to church.
Marilla wore her amethyst brooch to church that day as usual.
That amethyst brooch was Marilla's most treasured possession.
Do you have a minute to talk?
Government moves very slowly.
There was nothing the doctors could do.
"I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne," she said sharply. "I know you are."
Go to your room and stay there until you are ready to confess.
If she'd only have told the truth about it I wouldn't mind so much.
"She'll stay in her room until she confesses," said Marilla grimly.
In any case, she'll have to be severely punished.
Marilla felt deserted by everyone. She could not even go to Mrs. Lynde for advice.
Anne steadfastly refused to confess.
She persisted in asserting that she had not taken the brooch.
The eagle flew away.
You'll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That shall be your punishment.
Oh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic.
You are not going to the picnic and that's final.
Stick to the subject!
How shameless you are!
How fearless you are!
You're making excuses for her all the time.
Those were good times!
I still don't see it.
They'll go on consuming too much.
They'll go on arriving late.
I have barely any strength left.
Let's not beat around the bush!
Wash your face and comb your hair and put on your gingham.
Would you, please, hurry up?
I need it as soon as possible.
The odour disgusts me.
I hate sweet drinks.
Worse times are expected.
Have you thought about it?
The fog dissipated.
Do you already have a position?
The fog faded away.
Your opinion doesn't count.
Did you reach any agreement?
This is a controversial issue.
Tom begins his trip.
This is about cars.
Mine is electric.
Five minutes ago I was so miserable I was wishing I'd never been born and now I wouldn't change places with an angel!
Get a number over there.
I am passionate about reading.
I am passionate about ice cream.
I was passionate about watching movies.
I am passionate about technology.
I am passionate about bee-keeping.
We are passionate about books.
We are passionate about mechanics.
We are passionate about studying physics.
I still go out with her.
I still read every day.
I carry on reading every day.
I still play pool.
I carry on playing pool.
I still cannot see it.
I still do not see it.
I still think the opposite.
I am still freezing cold.
I still cannot dance.
I still do not understand anything.
We still maintain our stance.
They'll go on not eating fruit.
They'll go on lazing around.
They'll keep pressing the foreman.
They'll go on pigheaddedly.
I am a fan of the theater.
I am a theatre lover.
I am a fan of cars.
I am a car lover.
He was a fan of fishing.
He was a fan of wine.
"What a splendid day!" said Anne, drawing a long breath.
I was a fan of jumping.
Isn't it good just to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren't born yet for missing it.
He did not miss a single one.
The Avonlea school was a whitewashed building, low in the eaves and wide in the windows, furnished inside with comfortable substantial old-fashioned desks that opened and shut, and were carved all over their lids with the initials and hieroglyphics of three generations of school children.
"Marilla, have I really a pretty nose? I know you'll tell me the truth." "Your nose is well enough," said Marilla shortly. Secretly she thought Anne's nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of telling her so.
Charlie Sloane is dead gone on you. He told his mother--his mother, mind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That's better than being good looking.
I'd rather be pretty than clever.
I don't speak to her now.
That's Gilbert Blythe sitting right across the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you don't think he's handsome
He was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth twisted into a teasing smile.
Gilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing utterly.
Diana gasped.
Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert's head and cracked it--slate not head--clear across.
It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.
Anne, go and stand on the platform in front of the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.
Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head. "Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control her temper," and then read it out loud.
"I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe," said Anne firmly.
Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk a little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, "You are sweet," and slipped it under the curve of Anne's arm.
I am not coming back to school any more.
"I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana," said Anne sadly. "I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But I can't do this, so please don't ask it."
Don't you understand, Marilla? I've been insulted.
There's no use reasoning with Anne now.
I still can't dance.
Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher.
I don't know what education in this Island is coming to.
Mrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the head of the educational system of the Province things would be much better managed.
Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert Blythe to the end of life.
As much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and dislikes.
One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket of apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight, crying bitterly.
"Whatever's the matter now, Anne?" she asked.
I love Diana so, Marilla. I cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up that Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall I do?
Marilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no use; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and unusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted in amazement.
When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?
October was a beautiful month at Green Gables, when the birches in the hollow turned as golden as sunshine and the maples behind the orchard were royal crimson and the wild cherry trees along the lane put on the loveliest shades of dark red and bronzy green.
You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors stuff, Anne.
Bedrooms were made to sleep in.
You can ask Diana to come over and spend the afternoon with you and have tea here.
Diana came over, dressed in HER second-best dress and looking exactly as it is proper to look when asked out to tea.
"How is your mother?" inquired Anne politely, just as if she had not seen Mrs. Barry picking apples that morning in excellent health and spirits.
Our potato crop is very good this year. I hope your father's crop is good too.
Have you picked many of your apples yet?
Marilla is a very generous woman. She said we could have fruit cake and cherry preserves for tea.
The orchard, with its great sweeping boughs that bent to the ground with fruit, proved so delightful that the little girls spent most of the afternoon in it, sitting in a grassy corner where the frost had spared the green and the mellow autumn sunshine lingered warmly, eating apples and talking as hard as they could.
The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in.
Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble.
Her mother smelled her breath and knew she was drunk.
The stars in their courses fight against me.
Tom and Mary were absent.
I don't remember doing it.
Tom wanted Mary to be a stay-at-home mom.
How long will this go on?
Tom has some catching up to do.
We all had a good time singing around the campfire.
Tom told Mary that he couldn't do what she asked him to do.
How can I think about anything else at a time like this?
Tom calls Mary every day.
I feel we could be better.
This could end very badly.
Tom is a superhero.
Tom is a comic book villain.
Tom likes comics.
Tom collects Batman and Superman comic books.
Tom owns a comic book store.
Tom's favorite superhero is Batman.
Tom's favorite superhero is Spiderman.
Tom's favorite superhero is Superman.
Mary's favorite superhero is Squirrel Girl.
This a human rights violation.
Tom lashed out at Mary.
The Joker is Batman's archenemy.
Lex Luthor is Superman's archenemy.
Each layer of the Rubik's Cube can rotate in three dimensions and in two directions.
Tom used to sing better than he does now.
How many cars do you own?
Tom has some friends in Boston.
The clothes you washed this morning aren't dry yet.
It's probably a good thing that Tom wasn't at Mary's party.
How would you like to sleep in a nice soft bed tonight?
Tom died of brain cancer.
I haven't sung in a while.
Tom told Mary that she shouldn't do that.
How often do you do this?
What time did you close the store?
Tom's gun is missing.
Tom's parents are missing.
Tom has some money in the bank.
Nobody's ever said anything like that to me before.
It's hard to believe that Tom really wants to go to Boston.
How did you think you were going to get away with that?
Tom doesn't like to sing.
I used to hate doing this.
Tom says there's nothing wrong with that.
How worried should we be?
Tom has suffered some failures.
My job is to do what other people don't want to do.
We're gonna have a baby.
Accept the job and don't be afraid.
I want our baby to have your eyes and your mouth.
I want our baby to look like you.
Don't be afraid, Jamal.
You have to face it.
I don't have anything else to do today.
She needs a doctor.
Have some coffee, Jamal.
No construction company will kick us out of here.
This isn't all, Fadil.
Did you see what just happened?
I really miss Jamal.
You just have to stand up for your rights in life.
They have taken away all the garbage.
You two are really inseparable.
It's probably that plumber again.
He wants to know if he can see you.
What happened to you this morning?
We had problems with our car.
You need a short break.
I believe that there are other ways.
I'm sure we can find solutions with these people.
This is the student who organized the protest.
I'd say you are in love.
It's miles away.
I can see it now.
"What are you thinking about? "Nothing special."
Are you OK? It seems to me that you've been acting kind of strange.
Let's try now.
What happened to that man?
What's all this about, guys?
I crossed a stream and I got wet.
I'll give that to you if you behave.
"And the flowers?" "They're for you."
Just drop me here.
"You turned off the engine." "I'll wait."
You don't need to wait for me.
You don't know how happy I am that you've found a new friend.
I'll invite her for dinner.
That's not a dream.
Cut it out, will you?
Look at me. I'm soaked to the skin.
"I'm soaked to the skin." "So am I."
You'll never guess who this is.
Come on. You've got to guess.
I haven't had time to purchase flowers.
Whatever you order me to do, I shall faithfully obey you.
I'll help you fulfill your dreams.
What happened to me, guys?
Are you quite finished with this?
This isn't like him at all.
He tried to kill us.
You're thinking of unimportant things.
Your just coming here is a present.
"What's this?" "Open it."
I can't accept this present.
Don't tell me you don't like this aftershave.
I'll open it for you.
Can you tell me on which floor I can find Khalifa Contracting Company?
I feel happy giving you presents.
I don't wanna play games with you.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I don't wanna talk about that.
He never lets any boy close to you.
I found out that her son is a doctor.
Can I help you, Sir?
Do you have an appointment, Sir?
What you'd like me to do is help you find your wife, right?
I thought that would brighten up your day.
I'm hoping he can help me.
I'm looking for Jamal.
I'm extremely busy this afternoon.
I have to get back to work now.
"Thank you." "It was a pleasure."
Somebody is looking for you.
Jamal? What is he doing here?
Do you know who her friend is?
I'm Jamal, Sarah's husband.
So are you married to Sarah?
Shall we go for some coffee?
I can't leave the office.
Are you sure you can't take a short break?
My boss is here.
I'm sorry. I've got work to do.
Was it just me or was your friend a bit nervous?
I'm Tom, Mary's husband.
When she arrived, I wasn't in reception.
I'm Mary, Tom's wife.
I was in the bathroom.
"I'm sorry, Sir." "Alright. But no repeats."
I know you're a very responsible person.
I know that you want to become a doctor.
I've never had a boyfriend.
Most men don't even look at me.
Most men find me ugly.
Stop exaggerating.
I was in love a long time ago.
Jamal was my first boyfriend and the only one.
I forgot all about my studies and becoming a doctor.
He fell in love with someone else.
He fell in love with my best friend.
He even asked me if I would marry him.
I was just a little kid then.
It wasn't the right moment.
You have no idea how much I cried.
One day, all that pain turned into determination.
That's what we don't know.
We even have a small playground.
This way, Sir.
Did he tell you he was Sarah's husband?
"I don't understand." "It's better you don't understand."
He made me feel like such an idiot.
Is she talking to herself?
Would you tell me what the problem is?
Are you spying on us?
You just don't trust me. Admit it.
You're acting as if you were hiding something.
I wasn't watching you.
Where are you going? Come back here.
You better get in the car. I'm warning you.
You're hurting me, Jamal.
I'm really sorry if I caused you any problems or sorrows with Mr. Sadiq.
I can't afford to lose this job right now.
We need that land.
We will get the result we want by other means.
I'm sure there's an option that doesn't involve a bribe.
If I had a few days, I'd work everything out.
Why didn't he tell me this before?
I'm afraid of being betrayed.
I wanna try it again.
Falling in love is the most natural thing in the world.
I promised myself I'd never cry again for a man.
When you really fall in all, you give your all. You surrender completely.
I don't wanna be the other woman.
You can both achieve your goals together.
Let me know before you do anything concerning the clinic.
I'm your direct superior and you're my assistant.
Well in that case, I'll do whatever you say.
They cleaned the trash against the clinic wall.
I just received your card.
You can keep the rest of the money.
Was there money in your wallet?
Is there anything wrong, Sir?
I don't want you to understand.
I told you not to go up to that office.
Who asked you anything?
How did that wallet get there?
We have to talk, Jamal.
Leave the documents in my office.
You're behaving like a spoilt brat.
"It's quite normal." "With you, everything is normal."
Just leave me alone. Is that so hard to understand?
He jumped out of the car.
We're holding back traffic.
Jamal is going to help me with the wedding.
He doesn't have much time left.
I managed to convince Dad that we organize the reception at home.
Jamal is good at what he does.
You only see what you want to see.
"Jamal is not a saint." "Yet I trust him."
Did you ever find who was the woman in the photo.
I can't leave you there.
My stepfather hated me.
He just needs help.
What do you see in front of you?
Although this city is made of concrete, it's still a jungle.
I'm so afraid of him.
I didn't care anyone.
Who cared about me?
Who cared about what I was going through?
Please come in, Sir.
I wanted to have a word with Jamal.
I'm going to tell her you're here.
Sarah is naive and gullible.
I would like her to remain just the way she is.
I'm afraid you're going to hurt her.
Just leave me, please. I wanna be alone.
I don't have much time to tidy.
I hope you can understand.
Why are you here, Jamal?
I need to buy some medical books.
You're my lovely little baby.
It seems weird to me.
What if it was serious?
Tell me about it, Jamal.
Jamal arrived in a taxi.
He's going to his room.
"Did you have an accident?" "No. Nothing happened."
I guess I have some tranquilizers in my bag.
I'll go and see. Wait here.
I'd prefer to have a reception in my house.
In that case, so be it.
"May I go?" "Very well."
Jamal went to his room.
Jamal has an appointment with the college principal.
Just say Jamal isn't here.
I'll call Jamal tomorrow.
You better go ahead. Don't wait for me.
You and I seem to argue a lot.
We see things differently.
I asked Jamal to stay, but for a different reason.
These flowers are for you.
Before she died, your grandmother told me to give them to you when you get married.
Give me your hand, Jamal.
The wedding ring fits perfectly.
You're going to wear this ring for many years.
I just hope death isn't for tomorrow.
They both lived happily ever after.
Don't go yet, please.
We'll never have enough time together.
"I love you, my prince charming." "So do I."
He did that to my daughter.
Drink this, Jamal. You'll feel better.
I spent hours walking up and down on this street.
Running was my only defense.
We don't want it anymore.
I wonder what happened to him and Jamal.
Did you see the state she was in?
I know you don't want me to interfere, but I have to defend her.
We had hundreds of fights.
She doesn't deserve him.
We know Jamal's character, his great kindness, his courage.
One day, the whole world will tremble.
What do you expect her to do?
I got a good job.
I'm gonna make a lot of money.
You can't be sick for the rest of the school year. No one is gonna believe you.
I wanna see you right now.
Please don't thank me.
Excuse me for not having come over earlier.
I'm afraid that what Jamal said was correct.
I thought you have convinced him.
Doesn't he realize that if we don't get the land, our project is dead?
You're the boss. You decided.
You tell me what to do and I'll do it.
Did you give her the tranquilizer?
Do you need help, buddy?
We need to buy another bed.
Nobody is complaining. We don't need to worry.
That's no way to live.
Come and sit down with me.
We haven't had a talk for ages.
It used to be such fun.
Things have changed a bit.
It's to be expected.
My mom passed away.
The meals were on time.
Our clothes were always clean.
We call her the general.
She hated that.
I know something isn't right.
We got ahead in life.
There was love and respect.
He wouldn't let anyone separate us.
I ran.
I won.
I knit.
I paid.
I swim.
I bowed.
I cried.
I dozed.
I drive.
I drove.
I moved.
I snore.
I stood.

I nodded.
I obeyed.
I paused.
I prayed.

I yawned.
I'll die.
I'll win.
I'm a DJ.
I'm deaf.
I'm fast.
I'm good.
I'm high.
I'm last.
I'm neat.
I'm numb.
I'm slow.
I approve.
I ate out.
I bit Tom.
I blinked.
I changed.
I cheated.
I cheered.
I coughed.
I crashed.
I escaped.
I frowned.
I giggled.
I gloated.
I got fat.

I groaned.
I grunted.
I hate TV.
I made it.
I prepaid.
I relaxed.
I retired.
I shouted.
I slipped.
I sneezed.
I stopped.
I sweated.
If I can help our family like that, why can't I help Fadil?
I took it.
I was ill.
I was out.
I'll come.
I'll fail.
I'll lose.
I'm a CPA.
I'm a fan.
I'm alive.
I'm bossy.
I'm naive.
I'm picky.
I'm pudgy.
I'm scary.
I'm sharp.
I'm silly.
I'm small.
I'm tense.
I'm tipsy.
I'm wrong.
I beat Tom.
I canceled.
I did this.
I did well.
I exercise.
I flinched.
When I got married, I gave my oath to Fadil.
You're the sole reason of my existence.
Living without Jamal is unthinkable.
You have to learn from your sisters.
We don't have any cream.
"I'm starving." "There are some leftovers in the fridge."
I can't do everything on my own.
Jamal, hold on.
Don't complain, Jamal.
My dad is going to whip me just like a donkey.
I was going out anyway.
"I've come to see Jamal." "Come in."
I've come to visit my girlfriend.
You know that Jamal and Sarah don't get along with each other.
I had to leave the car in the middle of the street.
Why on earth did he do that?
I need to understand what happened in the past.
For the first time, I had the feeling that everything could end.
The woman I saw there wasn't the woman I knew.
I can't just give up on Jamal.
I don't want us to finish.
I don't want us to separate.
I don't want our marriage to end.
Don't think you're gonna get rid of me that easily.
Jamal was fired from the construction site.
I ran into her again at the shopping mall.
Does Sarah know about Jenny?
I ran out of gasoline on the way.
I want to get her out of my mind.
It won't rain on my wedding day.
Come with me outside.
Is your boyfriend here?
I thought he'd be here.
Is it too much to ask from you?
It's a tricky situation.
I really don't know what to say here.
I have come to ask you for your opinion.
Jamal seems very strong and professional.
Did you use to go out with her?
Jamal suffered quite a lot.
After Jamal, I don't think she has had any other boyfriend.
Then just forget her. Leave her in peace.
Make yourself comfortable, man.
Jamal didn't say anything.
Why don't we go outside so that we would be alone you and me?
"We kiss and make out all the time." "What's wrong with it?"
Why did you kick that guy out of the pizzeria?
Jamal is a dangerous thug. He always gets in trouble.
He still isn't back yet.
Nobody is hungry.
"Are you making tea for me?" "No, for Jamal."
I'm going to be in the bathroom.
Is it too much to ask you to set the table?
You can stay for dinner.
I promised to help my dad at the shop tonight.
The school called today.
They gave you a document your dad was supposed to sign, didn't they?
"I really can't stand the smell of tea." "It'll help."
"I wanna have a word with you." "Sure, what is it?"
You're the only one of the three sisters that doesn't hate me.
Not one word, understand?
I need to know if I'm really pregnant.
Jamal doesn't want to know about it.
Please understand this.
It's easy nowadays to find out if you're pregnant or not.
You have to wait for one month at least.
We have to do a blood test.
If I'm not really pregnant, I'm going to be so disappointed.
Not a word about this to Jamal, OK?
If you're pregnant, you'll be able to tell him yourself.
Did you tell Jamal?
Please don't tell Jamal.
Maybe I don't have a choice.
Do you need any help, buddy?
Have you set the table?
I'll help you, buddy.
He can wait until tomorrow.
You better find the courage to tell him tonight.
I'm gonna tell Jamal tomorrow.
That's the end of the story.
You're getting married in three months, right?
Give it to me, Jamal.
Come on and tell me.
You could forget about dinner.
I brought what she asked me to get.
I think I'd better go back to the shop.
You're leaving pretty early, aren't you?
"I haven't heard from Jamal since last night." "Not surprising."
Have you seen Jamal?
Now come on, Jamal, we're gonna be late.
I've never seen you in such a hurry to get to school.
Does that car belong to Jamal?
We've all agreed.
I don't have time to mess around with bribes.
It suddenly became a national issue.
The rules of the game have changed.
I got an A.

I was here at 2:30.
She tried to stay calm.
That couldn't possibly have any negative ramifications.
That couldn't possibly have any negative consequences.
The future is the result of the present.
It's really very good.
I'm traveling at my own expense.
She tried to tell the whole story.
I love this piece.
I know how worried you are about Tom.
You're bothering this poor boy!
The caiman is a very aggressive animal.
"You hate me, don't you?" "No, I don't." "Well, you love me, don't you?" "Why do you ask?"
Smalltalk rule number one: don't talk about politics.
Nice weather we're having, isn't it?

What's your native dialect?
Is that your native accent?
Is that your real accent, or are you just putting it on?
This isn't my real accent.
This isn't my native accent.
If he infiltrates our organization, we are finished.
If it infiltrates our organization, we are finished.
That's just a quirk of his.
You added an extra parenthesis.
As of yet, there is no method that can reliably cure all tumors.
We must digitize these books.
More than once in history have people revolted against the inequalities of life and refused to submit to the restraints of laws and creeds. They have often gone through a period of communism and red terror in the hope of realizing ultimately the Perfect State. Their leaders, undoubtedly sincere at first, espouse the utopian dream, declaring themselves the exponents of its ideals, the promised messengers of its blessings. But with the material for revolt ready at hand, and unable to resist the seductions of nascent power, they soon undergo that transformation which history identifies, often not unjustly, with demagogy, if they fail, or with autocracy, if they succeed. In either case, by utilizing the elements of negation in Society, they become apostles of violence, proclaiming the theory of "creative destruction." But instead of creating a utopia on the ruins of their making, they only succeed in setting up, as history shows, another government, which, no matter how just and sound its foundations are in theory, soon becomes in practice more despotic and corrupt.
I touched my feet.
Our table is wobbling. Give me your art book so I can make it stay still.
I warned you; now do as you wish.
He was where Tom said he would be.
The picture is hanging crooked. Could you please straighten it?
He sent me a catalog so I would correct it for him.
It would've been better if you had gone to Boston with Tom.
How do you make sure people do what you ask them to do?
Tom doesn't sing anymore.
I used to hate exercising.
Tom said he wanted something else to eat.
How would we get it done?
Tom has the ability to do that.
Maybe I shouldn't have gone there so late at night.
I wish Tom would stop parking his car in front of my house.
How dangerous do you think this mission is going to be?
Tom entered the building.
I'll try and do something.
Tom really didn't want to work with Mary.
How would you do the job?
Tom has three minutes to do it.
Let me tell you the reason I don't want to do that.
Tom wasn't able to stay in Boston as long as he wanted to.
How many hours of sleep did you really get last night?
Tom gives us good advice.
I'm even more excited now.
Tell my wife I love her.
Mary lashed out at Tom.
Tom is having a Super Bowl party at his house.
I wonder who will win.
I'm gonna watch football.
I'm taking some summer classes.
I'm really glad you decided to come.
I'm not a total idiot.
The scoring area is called the end zone.
Languages can form an infinite number of sentences with a finite set of elements.
Each team has 11 players on the field.
The game begins with a coin toss.
A standard football game consists of four 15-minute quarters.
A touchdown is worth 6 points.
To score a touchdown, a player must take the football into the opposite team's end zone.
A field goal is scored by kicking the ball through the goal.
A field goal is worth three points.
The channel has low signal-to-noise ratio.
Flag football and touch football don't allow tackling.
I declined the invitation.
Mary declined the invitation.
Tom's tweet was retweeted.
Tom's tweet was re-tweeted a thousand times.
Tom squeezed Mary's shoulder.
I've wanted to ask you out for a long time.
There, there, child, don't cry.
Don't be foolish, Anne.
She was suspicious of Anne's big words and dramatic gestures and imagined that the child was making fun of her.
I don't think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with. You'd better go home and behave yourself.
Won't you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?
My last hope is gone.
There is nothing more to do except to pray.
You shouldn't say such things.
"Poor little soul," she murmured, lifting a loose curl of hair from the child's tear-stained face.
I didn't think anybody could love me.
Nobody ever has loved me since I can remember.
In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my lonely life.
My heart will ever be faithful to thee.
"I'm going back to school," she announced.
Behave yourself and do just what your teacher tells you.
I'll try to be a model pupil.
Anne was welcomed back to school with open arms.
Sophia Sloane offered to teach her a perfectly elegant new pattern of knit lace, so nice for trimming aprons.
I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight.
She flung herself into her studies heart and soul.
The rivalry between them was soon apparent.
She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves.
She would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork, because that would have been to acknowledge his existence.
Anne's mortification was as evident as Gilbert's satisfaction.
Her triumph was marred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the whole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had felt the sting of his defeat.
Mr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly determined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress under any kind of teacher.
In geometry, Anne met her Waterloo.
All things great are wound up with all things little.
At first glance, it might not seem that the decision of a certain Canadian Premier to include Prince Edward Island in a political tour could have much or anything to do with the fortunes of little Anne Shirley at Green Gables.
A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned Waterloo stove.
Blue-white frost crystals were shining on the windowpanes.
Mrs. Lynde says Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run in Ottawa.
She says if women were allowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change.
What way do you vote, Matthew?" "Conservative," said Matthew promptly.
"Then I'm Conservative too," said Anne decidedly.
Ruby Gillis says that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl's mother in religion and her father in politics.
Ruby Gillis says when she grows up she's going to have ever so many beaus on the string and have them all crazy about her.
Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening. He says it is to help her with her lessons.
There are a great many things in this world that I can't understand very well.
"Oh, Anne, do come quick," implored Diana nervously.
He's gone to harness the sorrel mare to go to Carmody for the doctor.
Matthew and I are such kindred spirits I can read his thoughts without words at all.
The truth can be told gently.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
He just pretended that he doesn't remember anything.
The night was clear and frosty.
The stars were shining over the silent fields.
Tom is so handsome he could be an american president.
Here and there, the dark pointed firs stood up with snow powdering their branches.
I still live with my parents.
Knowledge and brave don't always come together.
There are some things that cannot be expressed in words.
That little redheaded girl they have over at Cuthbert's is as smart as they make 'em.
Isn't it a wonderful morning? The world looks like something God had just imagined for His own pleasure.
And what if you disappoint?
Don't change!
He doesn't remember anything. Not even his name.
The tinkles of sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through the frosty air.
Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch her aunt over at Carmody taught her.
If you love me as I love you, nothing but death can part us two.
I am your grandfather.
She has something very important to tell me.
We have arranged a way to signal with our candles and cardboard. We set the candle on the window sill and make flashes by passing the cardboard back and forth. So many flashes mean a certain thing.
I think you ought to let Anne go.
Who's bringing this child up, Matthew, you or me?
Argument was not his strong point, but holding fast to his opinion certainly was.
The fire burnt everything.
"Oh, I know I'm a great trial to you, Marilla," said Anne repentantly. "I make so many mistakes. But then just think of all the mistakes I don't make, although I might."
If I were you, I would help her.
Matthew understands me, and it's so nice to be understood.
They experimented with at least half a dozen different ways of arranging their back hair.
At last they were ready, cheeks scarlet and eyes glowing with excitement.
Tinkles of sleigh bells and distant laughter, that seemed like the mirth of wood elves, came from every quarter.
There was a magnificent sunset, and the snowy hills and deep-blue water of the St. Lawrence Gulf seemed to rim in the splendor like a huge bowl of pearl and sapphire brimmed with wine and fire.
The house was dark and silent.
Anne hurried home after breakfast.
I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty—it's so long since I used it.
I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no Mayflowers.
Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think they must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this is their heaven.
We had our lunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well—such a romantic spot.
We made wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats.
There's such a lot of different Annes in me. I sometimes think that is why I'm such a troublesome person. If I was just the one Anne it would be ever so much more comfortable, but then it wouldn't be half so interesting.
One June evening, when the orchards were pink blossomed again, when the frogs were singing silverly sweet in the marshes about the head of the Lake of Shining Waters, and the air was full of the savor of clover fields and balsamic fir woods, Anne was sitting by her gable window.
Tom really didn't want to work in Boston.
How you did it was wrong.
Tom has very few close friends.
Would you go back to Boston if you had the chance?
Tom says you were the one who talked him into coming here.
How long have you been working as a parking attendant?
Tom has gone to the park.
I'm going to do just that.
Tom never does anything unless he has to.
How big a problem is that?
Most people when they put a pie in the oven to warm up for dinner take it out and eat it when it gets hot instead of leaving it to be burned to a crisp. But that doesn't seem to be your way evidently.
Headaches always left Marilla somewhat sarcastic.
"Oh, I'm so sorry," said Anne penitently.
An irresistible temptation came to me to imagine I was an enchanted princess shut up in a lonely tower with a handsome knight riding to my rescue on a coal-black steed.
There is no such thing as a haunted wood anywhere. Who has been telling you such stuff?
"I can't go through the Haunted Wood," cried Anne desperately.
There are no such things as ghosts.
I know people who have seen them.
Charlie Sloane says that his grandmother saw his grandfather driving home the cows one night after he'd been buried for a year.
She's a very religious woman.
Mrs. Thomas's father was pursued home one night by a lamb of fire with its head cut off hanging by a strip of skin. He said he knew it was the spirit of his brother and that it was a warning he would die within nine days.
I never want to hear you talking in this fashion again.
A white strip of birch bark blowing up from the hollow over the brown floor of the grove made her heart stand still.
The swoop of bats in the darkness over her was as the wings of unearthly creatures.
There is nothing but meetings and partings in this world.
"I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him," reflected Anne. "I just cried because all the others did."
I just cried because all the others did.
Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.
The girls cried all the way home from school.
The time has come for us to part.
His wife is very pretty.
Mrs. Lynde says the minister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she dresses so fashionably.
Barns are painted red because red paint is cheap.
Why are barns red?
Tom hasn't read the letter yet.
What kind of people write fortune cookie messages?
Tom says that he and Mary didn't stay in Boston very long.
How many employees does this company employ full time?
I don't really know what to do.
Tom needs to do this by tomorrow morning.
How big a problem is this?
Tom helped me get into college.
We probably shouldn't have sung that song tonight.
Tom has been singing professionally since he was thirteen.
How do you know if your email account has been hacked?
Tom may not want to sing.
I'm sorry that I did that.
Tom lost three million dollars last year.
How can I do what's right?
Tom is a good basketball coach.
Maybe we can do that later when we're not so busy.
I knew you wouldn't like the kind of songs that Tom sings.
How did you come up with the idea for this exhibition?
Tom might try to do that.
I'm very upset about that.
Tom likes to sing Italian operatic arias.
How can people be so dumb?
Tom is a pleasure to work with.
Make sure your hair is dry before you go outside.
Tom may not have enough money to buy everything he needs.
How did they manage to keep this a secret for so long?
Tom must be out of money.
I decided I should do that.
I need to learn new things.
I got up at sunrise.
I hope you won't do that.
What on earth did Tom mean?
What I said to Tom was true.
What I said to you was true.
I came awfully near giving up.
I don't mind how much you talk.
I was afraid this might happen.
I'm glad I'm going to live here.
You've been crying, haven't you?
Tom is going to let Mary do that.
I wouldn't mind doing that for you.
Tom said he expected Mary to be here.
Why did you tell Tom it was my fault?
I don't think Tom needs any more hats.
That's something you need to remember.
Why did you tell them it was my fault?
I almost decided to give up doing that.
I suppose you won't be teaching anymore.
Why didn't you tell Tom it was my fault?
Why didn't you tell them it was my fault?
I do wish Tom and Mary would quit arguing.
Tom said something funny and Mary laughed.
I do hope you haven't done anything stupid.
I would never have thought of such a thing.
Tom told me that I could sleep on his couch
Tom always seems to be getting into trouble.
Tom said something funny and we all laughed.
I've lost three pounds in the last three weeks.
You won't find it so easy to do that anymore.
What Tom said to Mary was not completely true.
I wouldn't want to be the one who has to do that.
You'll have to be careful how you behave yourself.
Tom's mustache looks pretty good, don't you think?
I've been expecting trouble ever since Tom showed up.
I know you and I are going to get along together fine.
I don't think it was fair for Tom to get all the money.
The doctor says you must be careful to avoid excitement.
What I said to you was true, but I shouldn't have said it.
You won't mind staying here alone while I'm away, will you?
If I can't stay here, I need to find somewhere else to stay.
Lots of the little girls had artificial flowers on their hats.
How would you like it if people said things like that about you?
I saw Tom in church last Sunday.
You wouldn't like to be called stupid, would you?
Don't say anything about this to anyone.
I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here.
I've always kind of wished I'd forgiven Tom when I had the chance.
I think I shouldn't make a decision without consulting Tom.
I'm not going to Boston. I'm going to stay here and teach.
Tell me what you're crying about.
Stay here for a little while with me.
We used to be real good friends.
Tom and I used to be real good friends
Can I have those broken pieces of china that are out in the woodshed?
It was very good of you to do that for us.
It was very kind of you to help us.
I don't think anybody could do that.
I know that Tom went to Boston. I wonder if Mary went, too.
I know that Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too.
I thought I was following your instructions.
I thought I was doing this the way you told me to.
I wanted to buy a painting from Tom.
I wanted to buy one of Tom's paintings.
I could see my reflection in the pond.
I heard you say you liked pineapples, so I bought you one.
I can't say I'm sorry when I'm not.
When I woke us this morning, I didn't want to get out of bed.
I didn't feel like getting out of bed this morning.
I don't think you'll be able to do that.
I'm not yet used to being called Mrs. Jackson.
Will you please call me Tom?
You're old enough to do that on your own.
You're old enough to do that by yourself.
I think you ought to forgive us, now that we've apologized.
I think you ought to forgive us.
I think you should forgive Tom.
I'll go and have another look.
You've been working too much.
I'd do almost anything in the world for you.
Tom and I sat together.
Please don't say that you won't let Tom play with me anymore.
Tom has evidently made up his mind to do that.
What's gone wrong now?
I don't think I like Tom much.
I wasn't trying to be funny.
Tom must've been very unhappy.
Tom promised he'd do his best.
His avoidant tendencies led him to isolate himself.
Do you really think Tom will do that?
I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up.
I think I'd like to be a doctor when I grow up.
I want to be a doctor when I grow up.
I don't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself.
I'm sure Tom would never do that.
I'm sure Tom would never do something like that.
I doubt that Tom would do something like that.
I doubt that Tom would do that.
Your number is up.
The wind is beginning to blow.
Do you want more money?
The city hall authorized the sale of the land.
It's not gonna be easy. I warn you.
I want you out of my shopping mall.
That will be your final warning.
I've made you a cup of coffee.
You always work late at night.
Here's you coffee.
God how I hate this job.
I can't concentrate on my work.
What happened won't happen again.
You have really changed.
You do remember what I was like when you first met me, don't you?
The doctors told me there was no hope at all for you.
They don't know where you were.
They don't know where you came from.
I saw it in your eyes.
I saw another man.
And today, I still believe in you.
I believe in you today more than ever.
I'm invested myself for your company.
I have a lot more to lose than you do.
I think I may have found one.
Come to my office. We'll talk about that.
We're here to see you.
I hope your marriage lasts as long as my parents'.
Jamal is a terrible romantic.
There's some coffee in the kitchen.
Does Jamal know that you're going out?
Jamal left me a note.
We're studying together.
Where is Jamal now?
Please tell her that I came by.
Is there a problem, Jamal?
I really hope it's nothing serious.
You're here early today.
It's rare to find employees who are punctual.
Keep up the good work, buddy.
I have to go to school now.
I need an authorization from your legal guardian.
I'm here on a trial period.
I'm afraid that I have some other bad news for you.
She failed in five of her subjects.
She won't pass the end-of-year examination.
Hi there, good morning.
I wanna see if I'm pregnant.
Take a seat over there.
We'll call your name when it's your turn.
She's the problem.
I wanted to pass the year.
Nothing in life is easy.
You should make it.
Thanks for helping me get that job.
You have to start learning.
You better decide if it's the place for you.
Tom isn't the only one who plans to stay.
How can you not like this?
Tom is a really great listener.
If I were you, I wouldn't sing that kind of song.
Tom is the only one likely to be in the office on Monday.
How young were you when you first started doing that?
Tom sang and Mary danced.
I don't think they're safe.
Tom is one of the best coaches in Boston.
How did you get this idea?
She's serious about her work.
What is the problem, Jamal?
Tom is a reckless young fellow.
Do you actually think I'd do something like that?
Tom is the only one in our family who has been to Boston.
How would you boys like to have a little fun tonight?
Tom wanted to go fishing.
I don't want to play games.
Tom has never had formal singing lessons.
How did you pass the time?
Tom is a very energetic person.
You shouldn't have done that without permission.
Do you know if there's a bar in the vicinity?
May be a drink would help me relax a little.
I'll try not to be away too long.
Can you tell me when I can have the results of the test?
You can come back by 3:30.
I'm just resting for a moment.
The only doctor on duty is Jamal Sadiq.
You don't have to worry about me, sweetheart.
Why don't you come to work for this clinic?
She wants to find a husband.
You're completely out of your mind.
I guess I'm just romantic.
Tom didn't seem to be having any trouble convincing Mary.
How old were you when you started playing the guitar?
Tom wants a lot of money.
I enjoy working here a lot.
Tom drank out of Mary's glass by mistake.
How did you spend the day?
Tom is a very gifted young man.
We were expecting something different to happen.
I wouldn't have left early if Tom hadn't told me I could.
How much money do I need to save before I can retire?
Love is just a fancy.
Offer her flowers.
Flowers can be useful to say thank you or sorry.
Give me all the flowers you have there.
Just give me a price.
If you can give me a couple of those bills, maybe we could have a deal.
Is she a patient here?
She works here.
Maybe you could tell me where she is.
You can't just go up there.
Why don't you just take a seat there and wait for her?
"What's the purpose of your visit here?" "It's personal."
He's selling flowers.
Make sure he doesn't go upstairs.
I'm Sarah's husband.
And what do you want?
I'm pretty certain that they're all for you.
I'm pretty sure that the flowers are for you.
What's going on with you, Fadil?
What I have to tell you is going to make you scream.
I need to call the security guard.
You just wanted to become my friend to obtain information.
Right from the beginning you have lied to me.
You mean it doesn't matter?
I brought her chocolate.
Don't you see that, Jamal?
Did you tell Sarah?
I couldn't find Sarah.
She's here for sure.
I just need some time to find her.
I'm here waiting for her.
I'll do that myself.
I don't want his flowers.
Who says I have any secrets?
I don't wanna see him.
We spent yesterday morning together.
I started feeling things that I hadn't felt before.
I have no intention of seeing him.
He's still waiting for her downstairs.
Is this Jamal?
Excuse me, Doctor.
I'm not selling flowers.
They're looking for someone.
She's a nurse and she works here.
I asked the other nurses but they couldn't find her.
My marriage is the same. It's been on the rocks for ages.
Stop looking elsewhere.
Stop creating trouble.
You already have a wonderful husband that loves you.
He used to be the perfect guy.
Jamal is not part of my future.
Are you thinking of telling him about that?
His fate is already decided.
It's his problem. It's none of my business.
Jamal left the construction site to go get a drink.
He wasn't quite right.
Was there a problem? Something with my father?
"Please give me a painkiller." "No. I can't give you one yet."
Come back later, Sir.
Someone is waiting for you upstairs.
He's brought you flowers.
He asked me to find you.
If you drop it, I'll take it out of your wage.
If you drop that vase, I'll take it out of your wage.
Put that on my desk.
I was just taking a little rest.
You must be working hard.
Thank you for your kind attention.
I have to tell my husband.
We didn't do it on purpose.
The vase is broken. You'll pay for it.
Bring me those things I've asked for.
Can we run now?
Put that knife down.
I'm not gonna tell him I didn't find you.
Just say that I can't see him.
What if he insists?
He must leave now.
Please do it for me, sweetheart.
He's on his way back here.
Why does he always have to be late?
I've phoned him to remind him about it.
Let's tell him what happened.
Do you know how long I've been waiting for her?
Is that what she said?
Give her these flowers for me.
He's just tired of waiting.
I told him not to wait for you anymore.
I'm gonna go back to work and earn some money.
I told Jamal no.
Here he comes down.
We're gonna be late.
We have an appointment with the decorator.
I lost track of all time.
Tom is late again.
Give it to me, Tom.
Tom has the tickets.
Why isn't Tom coming?
Have some coffee, Tom.
Tom arrived in a taxi.
Are you married to Tom?
Don't complain so much.
Give me your hand, Tom.
Tom has an appointment.
You're hurting me, Tom.
Don't you see that, Tom?
Tom suffered quite a lot.
Tom is naive and gullible.
Did you manage to call Tom?
Does that car belong to Tom?
Why isn't Tom coming tonight?
Did you really do that to Tom?
I wanted to have a word with Tom.
Tom waited for you all afternoon.
Does Tom know that you're going out?
Drink this, Tom. You'll feel better.
Did Tom tell you he was Mary's husband?
Did you spend the entire morning with Tom?
I haven't heard from Tom since last night.
I'm afraid that what Tom said wasn't correct.
You know that Tom and Mary don't get along with each other, don't you?
I've come to pick up the results of the test I've done earlier this morning.
Congratulations, you're pregnant.
You know what this is?
It's a pregnancy test and it's positive.
I bought him a watch.
I was trying to deny everything that ever happened.
You're no a child anymore.
I'm going over to tell him right now.
Just control your emotions.
Do you at least know what this is?
I'm afraid you'll have to take the flowers away.
You know perfectly well that there are regulations concerning animals.
These flowers can't stay here.
And who else?
"Here you go." "Thank you."
You're gonna make a lovely couple.
I haven't told them about everything we're planning.
Ask my sister to show you.
Your wedding is going to be fabulous and unforgettable.
Did you check all the CDs? Are they OK?
Thank you for helping me, pal.
The CD is broken. It's useless.
I don't care. I'll pay.
Do we have the money?
I waited for you all afternoon.
I'd like to do things properly.
I collect souvenirs.
You can't imagine all the trouble you're in.
I thought you said you were ready.
I've been taking it easy on you.
I'll never quit.
My life has changed quite a lot.
I've won the race.
He's not gonna quit.
You want it? Come get it.
This will make me feel better.
Maybe you should take a look at this again.
Now you won't be able to deny what happened.
I know what I'm doing. I'm totally in control.
Well that moment has come.
What did the principal tell him?
You weren't at school yesterday.
I thought he wasn't coming.
I'm just really glad that you found a boyfriend.
I absolutely fell in love with those photos.
I love it. It's perfect.
Don't you like the flower arrangement?
Maybe you want to talk in private.
I didn't want you to tell him the truth.
I don't want him to know the truth.
He wasn't always like that.
I've come to see your boss if he's in.
It is something important for me and for you as well.
Decorating isn't really my thing.
I think that it doesn't make any difference.
I don't really give a damn about the decoration of our wedding.
Are you having second thoughts about getting married?
Do you still want to get married?
I'm not feeling very well tonight.
You can think what you want.
I really don't have patience for this.
You can take my car.
I just don't have time. Really, I'm going.
Here. This is for you.
I know you must still be mad at me.
He wanted to give them to me.
He's also very interested in you.
News really does travel fast.
I'd like to know something.
He just called me and he accepted the job.
We're gonna have to do a bit of shopping.
There is no turning back, Fadil.
If you don't want to do it, then I will.
You fold it, then you fold it over, then you fold it again.
I wanted to see what it looked like on her.
The dress really brings out her skin tones.
I'm Fadil Sadiq. At your service.
A few days ago, you wanted to marry Fadil, and now you want another guy.
Thanks for the coffee, sweetheart.
I'll buy you a coffee at the cafeteria.
You're going to give me that opportunity.
If you think I'm different from the other guys, then why don't you agree to come out with me?
"We've met before." "No. I'm sure I would have remembered that meeting."
I'm not used to such compliments.
Here's Fadil.
What on earth happened here?
What a great time we have had.
We have had a great day.
Tom was an auto mechanic.
I just want you to shut up.
Tom didn't need to leave in such a hurry.
How difficult can that be?
Tom is a very polite young man.
My mother often sings when she's washing dishes.
I wonder why Tom didn't tell you about what had happened.
How long did you think the meeting was going to last?
Tom wouldn't do anything.
I just wanted to do my job.
Tom decided he shouldn't stay any longer.
How do I apply for a visa?
Tom is able to play the guitar.
It was a lot tougher than I thought it would be.
I didn't know that Tom was the one who taught you French.
How do you know if your child is ready for preschool?
Guess who Tom's father is?
I knew I needed to do that.
Tom came home later than usual yesterday.
How do I open this window?
Tom is accustomed to traveling.
If you don't want to do that, you don't have to.
How will you convince Tom to lend you the money you need?
How do I know that you're telling the truth?
How did Tom get to Boston?
I might be able to do that.
Tom and Mary played tennis all afternoon.
How do we fix the problem?
Tom is afraid of being cheated.
Do you know anyone who would be able to help us?
How long do you think we can sit here before Tom sees us?
How did you support yourself before you got this job?
How much does Tom owe you?
I promise not to judge you.
Should I tell Tom not to do that anymore?
How do you deal with that?
Tom is all right at the moment.
Are you convinced this is the right thing to do?
How did you know Tom was going to go to Boston with Mary?
How could that have happened without anyone noticing?
We are here to see you all.
If I truly care about the poor, then why on earth am I not a Communist? It is precisely because I care about the poor that I am not a Communist.
We may have reached the point where cosmetics has replaced ideology as the field of expertise over which a politician must have competent control.
I dreamed last night that I was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a head.
Cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just when you especially want them to be good.
Oh, look, Diana, what a lovely rainbow!
Every night before I go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really sitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes I look for her footprints in the dew in the morning.
Anne got up at sunrise because she was too excited to sleep.
After breakfast, she proceeded to make her cake.
I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time.
What if the cake doesn't rise?
Can I fix the table with ferns and wild roses?
Anne felt that Mrs. Allan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.
All went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed.
Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose for you.
"Anne Shirley!" she exclaimed, "what on earth did you put into that cake?"
Anne, taste it yourself.
Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you used.
I suppose it's partly my fault. I should have warned you.
She cast herself on the bed and wept as one who refuses to be comforted.
I'm disgraced forever. I shall never be able to live this down.
"My dear little girl, you mustn't cry like this," she said, genuinely disturbed by Anne's tragic face.
Now, you mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower garden.
Isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no mistakes in it yet?
Have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me? I never make the same mistake twice.
"But have you ever noticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same mistake twice." "I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new ones."
There must be a limit to the mistakes one person can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through with them. That's a very comforting thought.
"Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs," said Marilla. "It isn't fit for any human to eat."
Excitement hung around Anne like a garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature.
She had come dancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow sunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.
I am invited to tea at the manse tomorrow afternoon!
Marilla had almost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into her model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment.
Anne thought that the morning would never come.
I believe I could be a model child if I were just invited out to tea every day.
The trouble with you, Anne, is that you're thinking too much about yourself.
A cool wind was blowing down over the long harvest fields from the rims of firry western hills and whistling through the poplars.
One clear star hung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's Lane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs.
She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy, with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph.
You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love.
Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir.
Mrs. Lynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation.
I'm so impatient to see her.
All the silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers thereof were "dared" to do them would fill a book by themselves.
Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right foot to the ground.
Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point in the huge old willow tree before the front doo.
Anne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which bounded the garden to the east.
Anne tossed her red braids.
I dare you to climb up there and walk the ridgepole of Mr. Barry's kitchen roof.
"Don't you do it, Anne," entreated Diana. "You'll fall off and be killed. "
It isn't fair to dare anybody to do anything so dangerous.
I must do it. My honor is at stake.
"I must do it. My honor is at stake," said Anne solemnly.
I shall walk that ridgepole, Diana, or perish in the attempt.
If I am killed you are to have my pearl bead ring.
Anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence.
"Anne, are you killed?" shrieked Diana, throwing herself on her knees beside her friend.
No, Diana, I am not killed, but I think I am rendered unconscious.
At sight of her Anne tried to scramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp little cry of pain.
What's the matter? Where have you hurt yourself?
"My ankle," gasped Anne.
She would have admitted that she liked Anne--nay, that she was very fond of Anne. But now she knew as she hurried wildly down the slope that Anne was dearer to her than anything else on earth.
Bring her in here and lay her on the sofa.
Matthew, hastily summoned from the harvest field, was straightway dispatched for the doctor.
The injury was more serious than they had supposed.
Anne's ankle was broken.
The thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. If I could blame it on anybody I would feel so much better.
It does seem so strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my imagination has its limits.
He told me all about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy.
Diana has been a faithful friend.
The Friday afternoons, they don't have recitations. Miss Stacy takes them all to the woods for a 'field' day and they study ferns and flowers and birds.
"There's one thing plain to be seen, Anne," said Marilla, "and that is that your fall off the Barry roof hasn't injured your tongue at all."
I love watching football.
The dews were so heavy that the fields glistened like cloth of silver.
I love writing compositions.
Josie Pye is sulky because she didn't get the part she wanted in the dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen.
Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be one of her maids of honor.
She was dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets that glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.
Miss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man inquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.
It'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something decent for once.
Christmas morning broke on a beautiful white world.
It had been a very mild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but just enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea.
Anne peeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes.
The firs in the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful.
The birches and wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl.
The plowed fields were stretches of snowy dimples.
Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew!
Why—why—Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!
"That's a Christmas present for you, Anne," said Matthew shyly.
"Oh," said Anne, "Diana, this is too much. I must be dreaming."
"Oh, hasn't it been a brilliant evening?" sighed Anne, when it was all over and she and Diana were walking home together under a dark, starry sky.
I felt as if a million eyes were looking at me.
I think I'm going to sleep at my place tonight.
I was proud of Anne tonight, although I'm not going to tell her so.
The winter weeks slipped by.
It was an unusually mild winter.
Oh, Diana, look, there's a rabbit.
The woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer.
I really think the woods are just as lovely in winter as in summer. They're so white and still, as if they were asleep and dreaming pretty dreams.
Marilla was not given to subjective analysis of her thoughts and feelings.
Marilla, as she picked her steps along the damp lane, thought that it was really a satisfaction to know that she was going home to a briskly snapping wood fire and a table nicely spread for tea.
She had told Anne to be sure and have tea ready at five o'clock.
Anne Shirley, what have you done to your hair? Why, it's green!
I thought nothing could be as bad as red hair. But now I know it's ten times worse to have green hair.
"Now, then, what did you do to your hair?" "I dyed it."
"Oh, Marilla, what shall I do?" questioned Anne in tears. "I can never live this down. "
I am the unhappiest girl in Prince Edward Island.
These headaches of mine are getting worse and worse. I'll have to see a doctor about them.
There is no sweeter music on earth than that which the wind makes in the fir trees at evening.
One of the causes of forest dieback is acid rain.
My grandmother had a delicious recipe of cod.
Do you know how much a pound of cod is?
This tastes like cod liver oil.
Cod fryings are delicious, but absorb lots of fat.
Prior preparation prevents poor performance.
How often did Tom do that?
I quite frankly don't know.
Let me ask Tom if he wants to go with us.
How do you make beef stew?
Tom is almost as short as Mary.
You should seriously consider going to college.
How did Tom talk Mary into helping him with his homework?
How come none of my babysitters ever looked like you?
Tom and I don't talk much.
I think I can handle it OK.
I'd really like to know why Tom did that.
How do you stay motivated?
Tom is already making progress.
You don't need to help us if you don't want to.
What would've happened if Tom hadn't been there to help?
How can you be so certain you haven't made a mistake?
Tom and Mary are divorced.
I think I'll take that one.
I was very surprised to hear Tom singing.
How far away is your farm?
Tom is always being a nuisance.
You don't need to do that if you don't want to.
Tom swore he wouldn't tell Mary about what had happened.
How can I be sure that I'm making the right decision?
Tom bought a toy for Mary.
I think those are the best.
I think we should ask Tom to sing for us.
How hard can it really be?
Tom is an extremely bright man.
You don't have to help us if you don't want to.
Tom said that he hated the last song we sang last night.
How are we going to fit all of this stuff in the car?
Tom cooked us a nice meal.
I told you to stop singing.
I think Tom would've done the same thing.
How has your life changed?
Tom is appearing on TV tonight.
When was the last time you replaced the filter?
Tom promised Mary that he wouldn't ever see Alice again.
How would you like it if everyone called you stupid?
Tom cut the envelope open.
I want to beat that record.
I think Tom has already tried to do that.
How is a new pope elected?
Tom is certainly a good player.
We've been planning this trip for three months.
Tom never locked his doors when he lived in the country.
How would you all like to have a little fun tonight?
Tom died in the collision.
I want you to stop singing.
I think Tom has already tried doing that.
How is this going to work?
Tom is doing a really good job.
We'll go hiking tomorrow if the weather's good.
Tom may not want to sing, but you should ask him anyway.
How often do doctors misdiagnose medical conditions?
Tom doesn't like baseball.
I'll be in Boston tomorrow.
I just can't believe Tom really did that.
How long have I been here?
Why didn't any of my babysitters ever look like you?
Tom is doing just the opposite.
We finally realized that we shouldn't be there.
Tom has a daughter that goes to the same school as Mary.
How much did it cost you to buy your school uniform?
Tom doesn't try very hard.
I'm hoping it won't happen.
I hope Tom doesn't know what you've done.
How long have you been up?
Tom is doing surprisingly well.
We didn't do everything we were supposed to do.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three granddaughters.
How long does it take you to do something like that?
Tom got his feelings hurt.
I'm not as busy as you are.
How much money do you think Tom has left?
How many games can we win?
Tom is feeling a little better.
Has anyone told you about what really happened?
Maybe I shouldn't have told Tom about what had happened.
How long did you think the picnic was going to last?
Tom had fun playing cards.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How long have Tom and Mary been fighting?
How many guards are there?
Tom is going back to Australia.
You should seriously consider studying abroad.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to get in the water.
How has your life changed over the last three years?
Tom has never been absent.
I didn't care what happened.
How do you think Tom was able to do that?
How much did that cost us?
Tom is going to be an engineer.
Why are we talking about me and not about you?
I wish I could get Tom to help pull weeds in the garden.
How has your life been different than your father's?
Tom is in prison for life.
I don't put sugar in my tea.
How do you know that Tom isn't in Boston?
How much food do you need?
Tom is going to be out a while.
What's the real reason you don't want to sing?
I promised myself I wouldn't complain about Tom anymore.
How do you think humans are going to become extinct?
Tom is interested in golf.
I don't really want to sing.
How do you know Tom was the one did that?
How much sleep do you get?
Tom is much better than he was.
We don't have anything like this in Australia.
We really thought Tom was going to stay for a few days.
How do you know the police don't know what happened?
Tom knew he couldn't stay.
I don't think I've mellowed.
How did we not know that Tom was unhappy?
How much time do you want?
Tom is much too young for this.
There are many other things we could be doing.
Tom tried to convince Mary to go to the dance with him.
How do you balance being a mother, a wife and a lawyer?
Tom might be coming later.
I don't think we'll do that.
How did Tom know we were looking for him?
How much will it all cost?
Tom is now a software engineer.
Let's list all the reasons we should be happy.
The only one here who knows how to speak French is Tom.
How did a nice guy like you get in a mess like this?
Tom never locks his doors.
I don't want to sing either.
How did Tom ever pass a background check?
How old are your kids now?
Tom is now in stable condition.
Let's list all the reasons we need to do this.
I wasn't the one who told Tom that he couldn't be here.
How could there be a storm on a day as nice as this?
Tom said he could do that.
I hope you're not too angry.
How can Tom win if he has no competitors?
How realistic is the plan?
Your new hat is elegant, Diana, and so becoming.
Do you suppose it's wrong for us to think so much about our clothes? Marilla says it is very sinful.
The air was fresh and crisp, and little smoke-blue mists curled through the valleys and floated off from the hills.
"Isn't it just like a palace?" whispered Diana.
That's the worst of growing up, and I'm beginning to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child don't seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.
In the evening, Miss Barry took them to a concert in the Academy of Music, where a noted prima donna was to sing.
The ice cream was delicious.
Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must be told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself.
Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen, where a hot supper was waiting on the table.
Marilla laid her knitting on her lap and leaned back in her chair.
The only light in the kitchen came from the dancing red flames in the stove.
Anne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that joyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled from the maple cordwood.
She had been reading, but her book had slipped to the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.
Glittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and rainbows of her lively fancy.
Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse she is.
It's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty, Marilla. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up.
Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history.
Tom is serving a life sentence.
It's not hard to guess what's going to happen.
I thought it was really nice of you to do that for Tom.
How can I keep my email account from getting hacked?
Tom set fire to his house.
I hope you're not too upset.
How are we going to get Tom to come home?
How tolerant should we be?
Tom is similar to your brother.
Is there any other way we could be doing this?
You'll always have a home at Green Gables as long as Matthew and I are here, but nobody knows what is going to happen in this uncertain world.
Jane says she will devote her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid a salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything.
Charlie Sloane says he's going to go into politics and be a member of Parliament.
We've got to make sure Tom doesn't ever do that again.
How would you feel if that happened to your sister?
Tom set his house on fire.
I just try to do what I can.
We're not going to let Tom sing with us.
How would you handle this?
Tom is still in the same place.
Do your homework as soon as you finish dinner.
Tom tried to ask Mary a question, but she ignored him.
How often do you use the camera on your smartphone?
Rachel is a good Christian woman and she means well.
There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks her share of work.
Tom has a vertical garden in his kitchen.
"Why, Anne, how you've grown!" she said, almost unbelievingly.
The child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this tall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen.
"I was thinking about Anne," she explained. "She's got to be such a big girl--and she'll probably be away from us next winter. I'll miss her terrible."
"She'll be able to come home often," comforted Matthew.
It won't be the same thing as having her here all the time.
Men can't understand these things.
Anne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked dreamily out of the window.
Sometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I'll do if I don't pass.
I wish I had nerves like Jane Andrews. Nothing rattles her.
If you can't be cheerful, be as cheerful as you can.
Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and wished so much you were with me.
Ruby asked me to feel her hands and they were as cold as ice.
When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from all over the Island.
Sometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon I'm always glad I'm a girl and not his sister.
Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over!
The girls say they know they didn't pass, but I think they did pretty well.
I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up until it is over.
Oh, you'll pass all right. Don't worry.
She hoped fervently that she would be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew's kindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement.
The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink from the reflection of the west.
I want to say a hundred things, and I can't find words to say them in.
They hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling hay.
Tom started talking to me.
I really don't want to sing.
Tom wanted to learn how to speak French.
How's your blood pressure?
Tom is taller than his brother.
Are you still practicing the guitar every day?
Tom said he would try to make it to our party tonight.
How much time have you spent discussing this topic?
Tom takes the bus to work.
I'm not going to sing today.
Tom thought it would be safe to do that.
How badly do you want this?
Tom is the captain of the team.
You're not expecting me to help you, are you?
Tom promised Mary that he would never see Alice again.
How much stuff have you accumulated over the years?
I'm not sure how I did that.
Tom promised he'd never hit me again.
How big a yard do you have?
Tom is very afraid of the dark.
You still owe me about three hundred dollars.
Tom must've known Mary wouldn't want him at her party.
How much pocket money do you get from your parents?
Tom told me where to stop.
I'm not sure what we can do.
Tom isn't very likely to know that song.
How can I thank you enough?
Tom is working on a term paper.
You don't have to leave if you don't want to.
Tom looked at Mary and wondered what she was thinking.
How many people have you told what really happened?
Tom wanted something else.
I've really got to get home.
Tom isn't really going to Boston, is he?
How can anyone be so naive?
Tom isn't a university student.
Why do things like this keep happening to me?
Tom hasn't sung professionally for almost three years.
How many hours do you actually exercise every week?
Tom wants things done now.
I didn't really want to sing.
Tom has decided to stay a few more days.
How can we let this happen?
Tom isn't going to be punished.
Why didn't anyone tell me about this earlier?
Tom doesn't really plan to stay up all night, does he?
How long do you think the concert is going to last?
Tom was forced to do that.
I didn't want anybody's help.
Tom couldn't find the light switch.
I'll miss Tom a lot.
I'd like to open a bank account, please.
Get the fuck out of my life.
Shopping is not complicated at all!
Tom has an unusually good singing voice.
How can you criticize that?
Tom isn't sure how it happened.
Why did you decide on majoring in journalism?
Tom didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done.
How long do you estimate it'll take to repair this?
Tom wished he were taller.
I didn't want to do anything.
Tom didn't have the confidence to do it.
How can you sleep at night?
I'm sorry that I did it.
Tom seems to be in a very good mood today.
Tom seems to be in a good mood today.
I wish Tom could be a little nicer.
Tom isn't sure what to believe.
Who do you spend most of your free time with?
Tom definitely knew that he shouldn't have eaten that.
How long did you think the party was going to last?
Tom wouldn't let go of me.
I don't always sleep so well.
Tom couldn't remember his doctor's name.
How did you break your leg?
Tom isn't the right man for me.
When was the last time you were really happy?
I didn't want to hurt her.
You have to believe me, Fadil.
I have only fallen for another woman.
I should stop and think a bit.
Are you thirsty, pal?
If I was you, I think I'd probably hit her.
Why are you telling me this nonsense.
What do you want me to do about this?
You seem very confused.
You never had a father.
Are you getting me?
Are you telling me that it's completely normal to cheat on my wife?
Why would I have to think that your behavior is different from mine?
If I had to divorce every time I had an affair, I would have divorced thirty times by now.
I've had enough time to think.
Fadil is born one of a kind.
Just because he's engaged doesn't mean that he isn't in love with Layla.
You have to fight against this other woman.
That's what I call sweet triumph.
Are you talking from experience?
I really don't want a battle.
To live is to fight.
Only the strongest survive.
Life isn't like a fairy tale.
My stomach feels like it's on fire.
"By the way, what happened with that pregnancy test?" "It came out negative."
They took advantage of it.
Fadil should never have got promoted.
I can't marry Layla and continue seeing other women.
Is it that difficult to understand?
I can't say the same about you.
The mayor was bribed to sell the land.
Just don't push this any further.
You can rest for a little bit.
Is he coming here?
Will you please talk to him and try to convince him?
Talk to him and tell him to come back.
Just go and lie down. I'll take care of everything.
I'll offer you a simple proposition.
Allow me more time.
Don't you think we should call the police?
We don't know where she is.
This idiot is out of your life for ever.
Come on, don't look sad.
"Where's Fadil?" "He's taking a shower."
I am not pregnant.
A woman in your situation could easily develop an ulcer.
I've probably got an ulcer.
Me and Fadil are alike, always thinking of other people.
Did you tell him that Fadil is here in my house?
He must be extremely worried.
Layla went missing from my house.
Do I have to repeat the story for you?
I don't want to talk about it anymore. I'm done with this.
Your father is taking the whole thing as a betrayal.
What if they heard you?
You could really get hurt.
I've read this in the newspaper.
I've read in the newspaper about people who got shot for far less than what you've done.
No one is going to shoot me.
I'm going to marry Fadil now.
So why are you here?
Did she let you in?
I'm very tired. I don't want to do this now.
I'll take you home and you can be with your family.
Where did you park your truck?
I can't believe they stole my truck.
My truck has been stolen.
Who would steal that stupid truck of yours?
This is exactly what I don't need.
I know who stole your truck.
Don't touch my truck.
Everyone is talking.
He's just a loser out of money.
I slept fine.
Get me a microphone.
Give that guy a piece of your mind.
I've decided it's time to stop now.
Please don't make this any more difficult than what it already is.
I can't marry anybody.
I know her and I've got proof that you date her.
I was so angry with him that I could have grabbed him by the throat.
I don't trust men anymore.
I had no idea I'd be betrayed so easily again.
I didn't get badly hurt.
Fadil lied to me.
You don't need him.
She has been chosen to lead the team.
Go in the house right now.
I saw her picture.
Let's not do this here.
Don't you know that everybody is talking about us?
Because Fadil is stupid, he messed it up.
Go into the house or I'll have to take you in by force.
If you leave me, my life will be nothing.
I promise you'll regret this.
Could you stop causing trouble?
I've earned it without you.
Fadil would like to see you.
Please come in and have a seat.
"Sit down." "Thank you."
I'd really appreciate it if you could fix that problem.
"I'm Fadil, it's nice to meet you." "It's a pleasure to meet you, Fadil."
If you're interested, I know some people.
You can count on me, Fadil.
You're wasting your time looking at his picture all day.
Why is Fadil here?
Do I have to schedule an appointment to see you?
This is more than just a visit.
I wanted to give myself a gift.
It's such an honor to be remembered by a person like you.
Why did Fadil come here?
Would you like a painting or a sculpture?
My sister is here in Cairo.
I thought you'd be happy to hear it.
If there's no enemies, there's no incentives, and the neocons needed enemies to do what they did.
Call her whatever you want.
"It's all over." "But only for the moment."
Take it easy, Fadil. Calm down.
So I'm free?
It's time for our story to begin.
How's everyone doing here?
Fadil has a lot of work.
Did you learn that speech by heart?
I thought he would be ready.
Is it ready yet?
Your check is ready.
"I supposed I could go in there now?" "Go through."
She just went to the administration to get a check.
Where is Fadil's truck?
I know you stole it.
I'll give you until the night for that truck to appear, otherwise I'll call the police.
Can you cover for me until I'm back?
I'll give you a check.
Why did Tom come here?
Tom and I are a lot alike.
Fadil has got plenty of time.
They told me there was a problem with the invoice.
"Your name is...?" "Fadil Sadiq."
I have to call the administration department.
You'll come with me, no matter what.
I'll be waiting inside.
I wanna be with you.
I'm sure he's coming.
I don't wanna think about him.
I don't wanna think anything about him.
Don't mention him again.
This clinic is much bigger than the one I used to work at.
Fadil Sadiq will be in charge with the laboratory.
"Layla is a certified nurse." "Oh, so you're one of us."
He was feeling perfectly fine when I examined him.
"Give me the key." "I'd rather die."
They called me and said there was a problem.
I'm sorry to make you come all the way up here.
If that woman is here, there's something she wants.
You've got to tell me.
I'm feeling much better now, thanks.
My blood pressure probably went down, but I'm fine now.
I feel fine now, really.
Let's go back inside. It's windy.
Go back in there.
Go back in.
Please tell me what's wrong, Fadil.
You didn't bring flowers today.
Could you please do me a small favor?
This is the last painting of our new collection.
You're not wrong about that.
I think this is exactly what you're after.
Maybe he came here to see Layla.
You don't have any manners, do you?
I know that you want me.
I know that you're still in love with me.
You left me.
Just stop playing games with me.
"What is it what you want?" "I want answers."
I'm in a very good mood today.
So what time do you get off work?
Make an exception.
I promise we'll have fun.
You've got no idea how much I think about you.
I'm really busy right now.
You can wake me up with a nice kiss.
When you come out with me, you'll see we'll have a nice time.
I don't want you to wait for me.
Sorry. I didn't mean to bother you.
Stay away from me, Fadil.
I'm absolutely and completely serious.
I already knew who you are.
You and I will have nothing between us.
I can't believe it. She doesn't like me.
That idiot came looking for me.
I told Fadil not to come back.
The truth is that I wanted to die.
I didn't say anything to Fadil.
Who's gonna believe him?
I thought you'd be happy to hear that.
I'm just not interested in that.
I wasn't going to tell him.
We have a lot to learn today.
Is he feeling any better?
That's all I'm asking for.
I really am sure.
He has been working on the project for a long time.
Bring me your resume. I told you there's a vacancy at my office.
Are you alone now?
The baby is still fine.
We've just admitted a patient.
I need an electrocardiogram for this patient.
I finally found you.
Is it open?
Fadil isn't in.
Can I help you with anything, pal?
Father and son working together again.
Why is this guy here and not Fadil?
It looks good to me.
It took time, but it was worth it.
Come, we'll talk outside.
They could throw me out at any moment.
I'm not leaving until we talk.
Stop thinking about it.
I swear I can't believe what I'm doing.
Don't you realize that my work is very serious?
You're making me lose my mind.
My life was a mess.
Now I don't understand anything.
Fadil won't take no for an answer.
Could you come here a moment please?
I'm gonna speak to you in your own language so you understand.
I'm in love with and engaged to Dania.
I talked to my fiance last night.
You can't mess with people's feelings.
"Do you understand me now?" "Every word."
We have an emergency in room 17.
He'll be fine, OK?
We're just waiting for your test results.
Can you explain to me what this is?
Maybe you'll learn a lesson from this.
He made a fool of me.
I didn't know anything about that.
I have yawned.
I always fall for the wrong guy.
I want to do him what he did to me.
He didn't tell me he was engaged.
We're not getting married. At least not this year.
Maybe they had a fight.
Maybe she had a fight with Fadil.
"Should I call him?" "Yes, I do think you should call him."
Stay away from me, Tom.
Please tell me what's wrong, Tom.
Where's Tom's truck?
Something very strange is happening in your office.
Does he work for this company?
He's still here in your office.
I'll sort this out.
Fadil is on his way.
He sees the world from a very communist point of view.
We'll have to be careful with this.
That's why I've asked you over.
He said something to me like I won't forget.
He's going to be my son-in-law.
Fadil knows too much.
What I don't like is that he knows too much.
He was just looking.
I've worked here for many years.
I'll take it to your office.
I was already leaving.
I just finished work.
I study medicine.
I'll just take these.
I'll be late for my classes.
Isn't that your brother's truck?
I didn't steal the money.
Why did you bring Fadil here?
I know he sells stolen cars.
All stolen cars end up here.
We didn't find a single trace of it.
Don't give any names.
No names, OK?
They told me exactly what they tell everybody.
Do you know how much that car cost me?
I wasn't even insured.
Hello. Is anyone here?
Fadil went to school.
This one is Fadil.
Did you talk to Fadil?
What does she think?
She's completely sure that she's not pregnant.
Let me go now.
I made these for you.
Even the police say it was you.
Go back to your house.
Nothing happened, right?
I don't care what they think.
Don't touch my porn.
What is Fadil waiting for?
Guess where I'm calling from.
I'm calling from my new office.
I don't see why I should tell Dad.
I must talk to Fadil.
Fadil is taking a shower.
There should be a key somewhere.
Never leave the key in the ignition.
Is he still in my office?
Could you come here a moment, please?
I was going to call you back.
Why are you in my office?
I don't need anybody's permission to come to this office.
I'll tell you the truth to your face.
He believed in my skills.
You know what your real problem is, Fadil?
Don't talk to me about respect after all what you did to my sister.
I spent months in jail because of you.
Are you accusing me of stealing?
You'll be kicked out of the company.
Whenever I close my eyes, the first thing I see is that woman's face.
Did he tell you that he would fire Fadil?
He still has some hope.
I notified Mr. Sadiq. He's on his way.
You know I love him, don't you?
How can you be proud of a man like that?
Nobody is important.
I think that love doesn't exist.
I just can't believe what you just said.
Don't tell me you were never in love.
Yesterday doesn't matter. Life is today. Life is now.
My life turned into a dark and shapeless living hell.
It doesn't matter. Not anymore.
But look at what you've got now.
But you have kids.
I tried to be the woman that Fadil wanted me to be.
I know that you're very responsible.
You must have seen him.
He's redecorating the office.
Fadıl know Jet Fadıl?
This office belongs to me, not him.
Get out of my office!
Wait for me in my office.
I don't want to have anything that reminds me of you in this room.
Everything is the same as before.
Where did you get the stupid idea of getting into Mr. Sadiq's office?
You have to understand that.
I tried to be the woman that Tom wanted me to be.
Did Tom tell you that he'd fired Mary?
I must talk to Tom.
This one is for Tom.
Maybe Tom had a fight with Mary.
Tom wanted to see him.
Tom wanted to see her.
Everything's the same as before.
It's probably not a good idea to do what Tom suggests.
How did you like those sandwiches we had for lunch?
What does Tom do for work?
I don't feel that way at all.
Tom could sing well when he was a child.
How did you deal with that?
Tom isn't very strict about it.
We go out and have dinner together sometimes.
Do you think Tom really intends to drop out of school?
How did you know I that was what I was going to do?
How are you related to Tom?
I don't know what they think.
Tom and Mary got married three days ago.
How did you get that price?
Tom just doesn't want to do it.
People are singing and dancing in the street.
Tom's injuries aren't as serious as we first thought.
How can you talk that way about your oldest friend?
How does Tom keep his cool?
I hope you'll come back soon.
Tom Jackson called the meeting to order.
How did you get to do that?
Tom just kept right on talking.
Nobody's ever been as nice to me as you have.
Tom isn't the one who wrote the songs I sang tonight.
How are we supposed to prevent that from happening?
How much is Tom being paid?
I hope you'll visit us again.
Tell Tom that I already know what to do.
How do you keep costs down?
Tom just makes it look so easy.
It's been a problem for the last three years.
Tom is the only guy I know who has a pilot's license.
How are we supposed to manage with so little money?
I feel no sympathy for Tom.
I never regretted doing that.
The police interrogated Tom for three hours.
How exactly does this work?
Tom just started talking to me.
You don't need to stay if you don't want to.
He believed they had destroyed it.
He believed that they had destroyed it.
Mary is a quack doctor.
The tongue is the midwife of all disasters.
Tawny owls are highly territorial.
Prisons are overcrowded.
When it rains, he takes the bus.
They didn't need to take a taxi.
There's a corpse in the basement.
Tom and Mary are both married, but not to each other.
How are people going to know what needs to be done?
I gave the bag back to Tom.
I really feel this is unfair.
It wasn't easy to convince Tom to leave.
How far are we from Boston?
Tom just wants things done now.
We've already done everything we have to do.
Tell Tom that I already know how to get to his place.
How would you like to work under those conditions?
I heard about you from Tom.
I think I did OK on the exam.
I'd hate to be in Tom's shoes right now.
How many chairs do we need?
Tom just wouldn't let go of me.
We're not the only ones who want to do this.
I knew you wouldn't like the kind of music Tom plays.
How would you like to be our wedding photographer?
I never spoke to Tom again.
I think I shouldn't eat this.
I told Tom that I would wash the dishes.
How much caffeine is fatal?
Tom knows all about that stuff.
We'll never be able to do that without help.
How long did it take for you to convince Tom to help?
How would you describe the kind of music you play?
I think Tom is quite right.
I thought it was really good.
I think Tom is a very talented musician.
How much cash do you carry?
A few hours' catnap will do you well.
Huh?
You're flushed.
Is Tom coming here?
I bought Tom a watch.
Is that what Tom said?
Why is Tom always late?
I didn't want to hurt Tom.
If I were you, I'd hit Tom.
Is Tom still in his office?
I thought Tom wasn't coming.
If I were you, I'd kiss Tom.
Tom is on his way back here.
I know Tom sells stolen cars.
I thought Tom would be ready.
Let's tell Tom what happened.
What do you expect Tom to do?
Why on earth did Tom do that?
Is Tom Jackson a patient here?
I thought Tom wouldn't be here.
If I were you, I'd talk to Tom.
Please tell Tom that I came by.
Was Tom the one who let you in?
You know I love Tom, don't you?
Make sure Tom doesn't go upstairs.
Tom didn't tell me he was engaged.
What if Tom insists on doing that?
I didn't want you to tell Tom that.
I don't want Tom to know the truth.
Just tell Tom that I can't see him.
I'm afraid you're going to hurt Tom.
If I were you, I'd ask Tom for help.
I brought what Tom asked me to bring.
Maybe you could tell me where Tom is.
I want to do to Tom what he did to me.
You shouldn't have told Tom the truth.
I saw Tom's picture in today's newspaper.
I'm not going to tell Tom that I didn't find you.
I thought you had convinced Tom to help us.
Tom is still waiting for Mary in the lobby.
Tom just called to say he'd accept the job.
Are you going to tell Tom about what happened?
Do you know how long I've been waiting for Tom?
Do you know how long Tom has been waiting for you?
I told Tom not to wait for more than thirty minutes.
I'm going over to Tom's house now to tell him about that.
Will you please talk to Tom and try to convince him to help?
I'm going over to Tom's house now to tell him about what happened.

The Four Great Classical Novels of China are Journey to the West (西遊記, Xī Yóu Jì), Romance of the Three Kingdoms (三國演義, Sānguó Yǎnyì), Water Margin (水滸傳, Shuǐhǔ Zhuàn), and Dream of the Red Chamber (紅樓夢, Hóng Lóu Mèng).
Pygmalion fell in love with the statue he had carved.
Shall I put my pearl beads on?
"There's something so stylish about you, Anne," said Diana, with unenvious admiration.
"Don't speak of your going away tonight," begged Diana. "I don't want to think of it."
The electric lights dazzled her eyes.
She was wedged in between a stout lady in pink silk and a tall, scornful-looking girl in a white-lace dress.
The white-lace girl kept talking audibly to her next neighbor about the "country bumpkins" and "rustic belles" in the audience.
Anne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright.
Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness came over her.
When the concert was over, the stout, pink lady--who was the wife of an American millionaire--took her under her wing, and introduced her to everybody.
I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at a hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and chicken salad every blessed day.
"Did you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?" sighed Jane. "They were simply dazzling."
Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of things not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had millions of dollars and ropes of diamonds.
"I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by diamonds all my life," declared Anne.
I'm quite content to be Anne of Green Gables, with my string of pearl beads.
I just couldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne.
I was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your queer ways.
You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so tall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if you didn't belong in Avonlea at all-- and I just got lonesome thinking it all over.
At heart I shall always be your little Anne, who will love you and Matthew and dear Green Gables more and better every day of her life.
Matthew, with a suspicious moisture in his eyes, got up and went out-of-doors.
I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends.
"You've been crying," remarked Josie.
A wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his fortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed among the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces.
Anne worked hard and steadily.
Anne has as many shades as a rainbow and every shade is the prettiest while it lasts.
"It doesn't seem possible that the term is nearly over," said Anne. "Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter of studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next week."
Anne, with her elbows on the window sill, her soft cheek laid against her clasped hands, and her eyes filled with visions, looked out unheedingly across city roof and spire to that glorious dome of sunset sky and wove her dreams of a possible future from the golden tissue of youth's own optimism.
His father can't afford to send him to college next year.
Tom can't afford to go to college.
The news spread quickly through Avonlea.
When the calm night came softly down over Green Gables the old house was hushed and tranquil.
In the parlor lay Matthew Cuthbert in his coffin, his long gray hair framing his placid face on which there was a little kindly smile as if he but slept, dreaming pleasant dreams.
"Oh, Marilla, what will we do without him?" "We've got each other, Anne."
He looks a lot like his father did at the same age.
How sadly things had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home! Then she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy with promise.
Oh, Marilla, you don't mean to sell Green Gables!
I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home.
Marilla broke down and wept bitterly.
"You mustn't sell Green Gables," said Anne resolutely.
When I left Queen's my future seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought I could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I don't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the best does.
I'm just as ambitious as ever. Only, I've changed the object of my ambitions.
"Nonsense!" Anne laughed merrily. "There is no sacrifice. Nothing could be worse than giving up Green Gables—nothing could hurt me more."
Bless my heart!
Anne ran down the clover slope like a deer, and disappeared in the firry shadows of the Haunted Wood.
"There's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways." "There's a good deal more of the woman about her in others," retorted Marilla.
Anne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh flowers on Matthew's grave.
There was a freshness in the air as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover.
Beyond lay the sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur.
"Dear old world," she murmured, "you are very lovely, and I am glad to be alive in you."
"I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him," said Marilla with a dry smile.
Were we really there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes.
The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow.
Anne's horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after coming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be narrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.
"God's in his heaven, all's right with the world," whispered Anne softly.

How would you have done it?

You should try to avoid eating greasy food.
Tom couldn't have passed that test without cheating.
How could you take that job without consulting me?
Tom handled that very well.
I'm going to study all night.
How many times has Tom done that to you?
How you did that was wrong.
Tom later died at the hospital.
Why would you do that if you don't have to?
Tom and I both came to Boston when we were children.
How could you get involved with a woman like that?
I don't really know if I can eat anything.
Tom needs something to eat.
You will answer truthfully, won't you?
Tom needs something to do.
Tom said he wanted something to eat.
I'm going out

I want to help you fulfill your dreams.

I'd appreciate it if you could come early and help me get ready for the party.
I wanted to buy that painting, but it had already been sold to somebody else.
I promise I'll pay you back the money I owe you before the end of the month.
I'm sure I won't be able to tell you anything that you don't already know.
I think if someone acts like a child they should be treated like a child.
I'll do whatever I can to convince you that we should get back together.
I would rather stay at home and watch TV than to go to a movie theater.
I asked the man at the door what his name was, but he wouldn't tell me.
I warned you what would happen if you didn't do what I told you to do.
I don't think it really matters who does this as long as it gets done.
I'm not sure it's a good idea for you to go out at night by yourself.
I don't know if we're going to be able to do this without some help.
I don't know how we're going to prevent that from happening again.
I'll pay you this time, but next time I won't give you any money.
I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you have a good time here.
I don't think we're going to be able to be at your party tonight.
I don't think there's any way I can get this report done on time.

I stayed with the Jacksons whenever my parents were out of town.

I was just pretending I was rich.
I was rich a couple of years ago.
I was too weak to get out of bed.
I wasn't as poor as my neighbors.
I wonder how simple it really is.
I would do anything to get there.
I'd like for you to do something.
I'd never let that happen to you.
I'll do whatever it takes to win.
I'll never be able to forget you.
I'm getting ready to bake a cake.

I'm only doing what I have to do.
I'm pretty sure that I won't win.
I'm seldom late for appointments.

I'm very proud of my performance.
I've already told you what to do.
I've already written three books.

It's so nice to be appreciated.
It's time for you to come home.

I know about that already.
I knew about that already.
My grandfather was a policeman.
I was carjacked.
It's obvious that you're lying.
I've never bought clothes online.
The trouble with you, Tom, is that you never listen to what other people say.
I might be busy on Monday.
I had to work all weekend.
Next week, I'm going to Boston.
I was born rich.
It was bitterly cold in Boston.
Tom and Mary used to live in the house that John and Alice live in now.
I never take long showers.
I glanced down at my feet.
None of us want that to happen.
I was all wrong.
It isn't always cold in Boston.
I've worked with a lot of people.
I'm sure that Tom won't be able to understand what we're talking about.
I never was sophisticated.
I don't have a ticket yet.
One of us will have to do that.
I was all alone.
How much is a ticket to Boston?
I've promised to take Tom and Mary to the beach for a picnic tomorrow.
I never would've given up.
I don't feel tired at all.
Please eat as much as you want.
I was acquitted.
Everybody's excited about that.
I almost always wear dark clothes.
Tom went upstairs with Mary and sat by her bed until she fell asleep.
I never would've hurt you.
I do believe you're right.
Put that back where it belongs.
I wanted to win.
I was under the impression that Tom and Mary wanted to adopt a girl.

I waited nearby.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
I always try to help other people.
I try to always be nice to Tom, even though he's not nice to me.

Can you suggest something else?
I really think it would be better to let Tom do that by himself.
I seldom eat Mexican food.
I already know what to do.
Some people think I'm eloquent.
I turned around.
Actually, that's probably true.
I always try to keep an open mind.

That is one of my daily chores.
I took a chance.
You've worked very hard today.

You're not going yet, are you?

Tom told Mary not to worry about what might happen on Monday.
I try to eat healthy food.
I almost never wear a hat.
The negotiation was successful.
I sure am lucky.
You sing a lot better than me.
Tom went to Boston last year to live with his grandmother.
I wanted to do that again.
I've never been disloyal.
There's no way you can do that.
I stayed silent.
You shouldn't be in this room.
I ate something that made me sick.
Tom sold the farm after Mary died and went back to Boston.
I was skiing last weekend.
I've gotten used to this.
There's nothing we can do here.
I stayed seated.
Why weren't more people there?
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom that I don't like him anymore.
I was thirty at that time.
I've come to pick you up.
This song brings back memories.
I slept outside.
Why don't you want to do that?
I can't do much else at this time.
I was trying to teach Tom how to play that song yesterday.
I wasn't assertive enough.
I've already checked out.
We can't do what you're asking.
I slept an hour.
Why don't you like me anymore?
I'm going over to Tom's to help him clean out his garage.
I wonder who that man was.
I've already checked in.
Are you the one who wanted this?
I skipped lunch.
Why do you want me to do that?
I can't do that until next Monday.
I could've gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
I'd love to do that again.
Doesn't that seem ironic to you?
I shut the door.
Why didn't you get any apples?
Tom wants to know if he can keep that book you sent him.
I'll be in town on Monday.
I'm the one who did that.
Everybody ran out into the hall.
I should've won.
What have you got in that box?
I didn't think I was being unkind.
Tom says if you do that, Mary will probably yell at you.
I'll get there eventually.
I'm sure I won't like it.
How much money do you have left?
I should try it.
We've made no commitments yet.
Tom advised me to sell the farm and live somewhere else.
I'll lend you my textbook.
I'm so ashamed of myself.
It's time for us to get serious.
I shifted gears.
We're going to miss you a lot.
I don't even have a pair of shoes.
I would think Tom would be very glad to do that for you.
I'll try it again tonight.
I'm reluctant to do that.
Let's talk about global warming.
I set the timer.
We're going to do what we can.
I didn't want to say anything that might make Tom angry.
I'm already working on it.
I'm feeling a lot better.
Mary is charming and attractive.
I set the table.
We should've done this sooner.
I get ear infections all the time.
Tom said to tell you he's sorry he can't be here today.
I'm not expecting anybody.
I'm doing that right now.
Mary threw her purse on the bed.
I sensed danger.
We never should've gone there.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
I'm not sure who did that.
I'm afraid I'll get lost.
Maybe we should stop doing this.
I seldom go out.
We need you to do that for us.
I get headaches from time to time.
One of us will have to drive over and see Tom tomorrow.
I'm one of your neighbors.
I work eight hours a day.
No one told me what I should do.
We had no idea what to expect.
Tom and Mary have been married for almost three years.
I'm told I was a cute kid.
I went surfing yesterday.
One of those girls is my sister.
I sat back down.
We don't do this often enough.
I had no money on me at that time.
Tom hasn't been home since he graduated from college.
I've already done enough.
I was terrified to death.
One of those guys is my brother.
I read the note.
We appreciate your being here.
Please don't say anything to Tom about my being here.
I've done enough already.
I was painting a picture.
Some people think I'm eccentric.
I ran to school.
This isn't what I had in mind.
I have friends all over the world.

I've already eaten supper.
I was homeless last year.
That happens to me all the time.
I ran for cover.
These golf clubs are for sale.
I've already done everything Tom has asked me to do.
I was allowed to do that.
That's just not going to happen.
I paid the rent.
There's nothing we need to do.
I haven't been to Boston in years.
I'm trying to be as much like Tom as I possibly can.
I've just moved to Boston.
I was advised to do that.
Things are just getting started.
I paid the fare.
There's no money in my wallet.
Do you think Tom knew that that was going to happen?
I've never ridden a horse.
I wanted to do that, too.
This happens to me all the time.
I paid by check.
There were firemen everywhere.
I haven't even looked at that yet.
A man as old as Tom doesn't make new friends easily.
I've never studied French.
I used to be the manager.
This is more than enough for me.
I ordered lunch.
The door was already unlocked.
Who do you think speaks French better, Tom or Mary?
I always do that by myself.
I try not to be wasteful.
This isn't French. It's English.
I often do this.
That's enough food for a week.
I haven't had time to tidy up yet.
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
I always go home for lunch.
I tried to act impressed.
We can't give you what you want.
I never was shy.
Please show me how to do that.
Tom told Mary not to worry about what might happen.
I always wanted a daughter.
I stayed here all summer.
You'd better eat something, too.
I needed a bath.
Please do the same thing I do.
I haven't made up my mind on that.
Tom thought Mary would want him to do that for her.
I always wear a blue shirt.
I seldom use power tools.
Are you speaking from experience?
I must be wrong.
Not everyone wants to be here.
Tom and I have decided to go to Boston next summer.
I always worry about money.
I read the whole article.
Aren't you growing tired of this?
I may still win.
Mary is prettier than you are.
I haven't missed a single meeting.
Tom and I had a long talk the night before he died.
I asked Mary out on a date.
I plan to move to Boston.
Can I have another piece of cake?
I may need help.
Make sure you're here by 2:30.
Perhaps when Tom and I are older we'll get married.
I ate my lunch a while ago.
I often wear blue shirts.
How would you like to go with us?
I may come back.
Look at the mess we have here.
I kept a diary when I was younger.
It would've been better if Tom hadn't married Mary.
I believe that'll happen.
I often hum while I work.
Is that man over there a teacher?
I married young.
Let's have some fun, shall we?
I've already done everything Tom has told me to do.
I brought a bottle of wine.
I may come here tomorrow.
Mary forgot her purse in her car.
I made us lunch.
It's going to be fun, I think.
I knocked over a jug and broke it.
I'll have to ask Tom to come over and do it for me.
I came here to play tennis.
I know that you're smart.
Mary is a very good-looking girl.
I made pancakes.
It's been windy all afternoon.
I went to the same school that Tom is going to now.
I can't hold on any longer.
I have one of those, too.
Maybe everything'll go all right.
I made a speech.
It's been a tough year for me.
I think I may have killed someone.
I don't know how many brothers and sisters Tom has.
I did really well, I think.
I hardly ever wear a hat.
Put that back where you found it.
I made a U-turn.
It might be snowing in Boston.
Tom worked as a teacher in Boston for a few years.
I didn't do that very well.
I got out of bed quickly.
The teacher says I'm a smart kid.
I love to drive.
Don't you remember my promise?
I think we could've done that better.
Tom says if you don't do that, Mary will be angry.
I don't care who does that.
I enjoy horseback riding.
I love children.
Don't you dare try to do that.
Tom said there was something we had to talk about.
I don't care who does this.
I don't use paper towels.
We can't give you any more money.
I lost the race.
Don't underestimate the enemy.
I think things are getting better.
I've never told Tom about what we did that summer.
I don't do that very often.
I don't think I'm biased.
We have a lot of mashed potatoes.
I looked inside.
Doing this is a waste of time.
I'm sure that Tom didn't mean to be disrespectful.
I don't like chopping wood.
I don't often wear a hat.
We have a lot of things to do today.
I lit the stove.
Doing that would've been easy.
I thought it would be here by now.
I never wanted to do anything Tom suggested we do.
I don't think I'm immature.
I don't often tell jokes.
Dancing makes me feel young again.
I liked to draw.
Didn't I tell you not to sing?
Tom said we could ask him any questions we liked.
I don't think I'm neurotic.
I don't have that choice.
Does this bus go the Hilton Hotel?
I liked it, too.
Did you think I looked scared?
I volunteer at a homeless shelter.
I want to thank you for what you've done for Tom.
I drew a picture of a tree.
I already know the truth.
How could anyone ever forget that?
I like to skate.
Did you come here last Monday?
Tom was talking to me about that this afternoon.
I drove as fast as I could.
I've stopped doing that.
How could you ask me such a thing?
I like the idea.
Batteries are sold separately.
I want to learn more about Boston.
Tom told me that I needed to be more aggressive.
I grew a beard last summer.
I've never seen a whale.
How dangerous would doing that be?
I like that one.
You'll go with us, won't you?
Tom told Mary where she could buy imported wine.
I have to be there at 2:30.
I've hired a new lawyer.
How did this magazine get started?
I like redheads.
Why don't you guys like me?
I won't survive without your help.
Tom couldn't have done that by himself, I think.
I haven't eaten much today.
I've grown used to this.
How did you come up with the idea?
I like lacrosse.
Why didn't you bring it home?
I'd be very careful if I were you.
I didn't show Tom the pictures he wanted to see.

I've been so happy here.
How did you end up in foster care?
I knocked again.
Why are you doing this again?
I'll try and not mention it again.
How can you stand being around Tom all the time?
I did it just for fun.
I've already fixed that.
How did you get into my apartment?
I knew all that.
Why are we listening to this?
I'll try not to forget to do that.
You don't like Tom and me the same way, do you?
I just wasn't ready for it.
How did you guys end up in Boston?
I kept laughing.
Who wouldn't want to do that?
I'll wait here until you get back.
Tom said he was sorry that he couldn't help me.
I keep bumping into things.
I've already had lunch.
How do you know they're Canadians?
I kept fighting.
Who said I wouldn't be there?
I'm happier now than I used to be.
Tom is just as good a tennis player as Mary is.
I knew it was time to stop.
How do you plan to deal with that?
I kept climbing.
What inspired you to do that?
I'm no longer planning to do that.
Tom is beginning to look a lot like his father.
I knew you would like this.
I'm too weak to do that.
How else can we feed our families?
I kept cleaning.
What do you have in that box?
I'm not as rich as you think I am.
People Tom's age don't make new friends easily.
I listen to a lot of music.
I'm prepared to do that.
How good is your office door lock?
I just shrugged.
We've got to quit doing this.
I'm not as weak as you think I am.
It's kind of disappointing that Tom isn't here.
I love both Mary and Alice.
I'm already over thirty.
How long have you been doing that?
I just listened.
We used to often play tennis.
I'm one of Mr. Jackson's students.
I wonder if Tom looks anything like his father.
I'm already on the list.
How long will it take to fix this?
I heard a shout.
We often sing hymns together.
I'm right here I'm supposed to be.
I told everyone that Tom would be here by 2:30.
I never was very practical.
I'm already a bit tipsy.
How many deals are you working on?
I have red hair.
We haven't changed the rules.
I'm surprised I made it to thirty.
I don't think Tom really planned on doing that.

I'll always be with you.
How many girlfriends have you had?
I have no alibi.
We don't know what'll happen.
I'm the one who broke that window.

I never would've said that.

We do this almost every week.
I'm the worst singer in the group.

How much water do you drink a day?
I have a ticket.
That's absolutely ridiculous.
I don't think I've changed so much.
Tom wouldn't let anybody do anything for him.

I was the one who did that.
I never was very strong.
How will we feed all these people?

I've already given Tom what he really wanted.
I wasn't surprised by that.
I never was pessimistic.
It doesn't hurt that much anymore.
I had a bad day.
Mary is a plain-looking girl.
I might be able to do that for you.
I thought of something that we could do, Tom.
I won't ask you to do that.
I never wanted you here.
Mary is a very good-looking woman.
I guessed wrong.
Mary gave away all her dolls.

Please don't try to do that again.
I got depressed.
It makes me feel young again.
I'd never allow that happen to you.
Tom has got nobody to look after him but me.
I'm seldom late for school.
I guess you can have it.
That isn't likely to happen today.
I got beaten up.
It didn't happen by accident.
I'm not as lucky as you think I am.
Tom has been trying to teach me how to cook.
I'm the one who needs help.
I don't often come here.
That's probably not actually true.
I found my bike.
I'm not as naive as you think I am.
Tom asked me who the girl with red hair was.
I'm thin, but not too thin.
This is a nice-looking campground.
I felt nauseous.
How is the weather in Boston?
I'm not as smart as you think I am.
Pay Tom back the thirty dollars you owe him.
I'm very open to new ideas.
I don't like doing that.
When will you be coming to Boston?
I felt homesick.
How do you know how old I am?
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I wonder if Tom could tell us where Mary is.
I've already arranged that.
I didn't wait very long.
You're too young to be doing that.
I felt helpless.
Do you plan to have children?
I'm not buying anything else today.
I wonder how much money Tom has in the bank.
I've already set the table.
I did what everyone did.
Actually, that's probably not true.
I felt excluded.
Can I have some more pudding?
I'm not going to bother doing that.
I was the one who taught Tom how to do that.
I've already told everyone.
I did that just for fun.
Are you the person who wanted this?
I felt confused.
Are you still in high school?
I'm pretty sure that it won't work.
I think Tom would've liked to be here today.
I've been awake since 6:30.
I couldn't help smiling.
Doing that will be a waste of time.
I feel insecure.
You'll never get bored here.
I've already decided where to live.
I overheard Tom and Mary talking about John.
I've never eaten Thai food.
I always get up at 7:30.
Have you finally made up your mind?
I fed the horse.
Why are you working so late?
I've already published three books.
I never told Tom what he was supposed to do.
I've never lived in Boston.
I always get up at 6:30.
How are we better than any of them?
I fed the goats.
Who would want to live here?
I've already taken out the garbage.
I can't believe Tom really wants to do that.
I've told you that already.
I already knew about it.
How can people do things like this?
I eat out a lot.
What's the matter with this?
I've already taken the garbage out.
I can't believe Tom really plans to do that.
I almost forgot to buy milk.
I already have a ticket.
How can something like this happen?
I drove to work.
What did the specialist say?
I've caused enough trouble already.
Did Tom ever tell you what Mary looked like?
I already have one of these.
I almost died yesterday.
How come you didn't get any apples?
I didn't object.
We're going to have to move.
I already know what my opinions are.
Tom said that it looked like I was worried.
I already know what's wrong.
I almost always do that.
How come you don't like me anymore?
I didn't flinch.
We need to create more jobs.
I already know what your opinion is.
Tom said that he thought I was incompetent.
I always sleep on the floor.
I've already said yes.
How could we have been so careless?
I didn't buy it.
We hope that you'll do that.
I always eat before going to school.
Tom is the only close friend I've got here.
I always try to be friendly.
I'm sometimes careless.
How did you first get into cycling?
I did that, too.
We have to create more jobs.
I came here almost thirty years ago.
Tom doesn't know whether to do that or not.
I always try to help others.
I wore a hat yesterday.
How did you fracture your shoulder?
I did just that.
We have a chance of winning.
I can't believe you really did that.
Tom could've done that by himself, I think.
I always wear a tie to work.
I won't argue with you.
How did you get interested in wine?
I did just fine.
We don't do this very often.
I didn't have to wait for very long.
Tom and Mary sang "Happy Birthday" to John.
I believe that won't happen.
I wish you would leave.
How did you get into this business?
I did all right.
This is the one I like best.
I don't know what I should be doing.
I think I need to do something to help Tom.
I don't want to give up yet.
I was told to be quiet.
How do we explain this to the kids?
I cook with gas.
This is just what we needed.
I don't know what I'll do next week.
I might go running with Tom this afternoon.
I drank too much last night.
I was the last in line.
How do you decide what to focus on?
I chose to wait.
This is all we can give you.
I don't like Chinese food very much.
I lived with Tom in Boston for three years.
I hardly ever win arguments.
I was crazy to do that.
How do you decide what's important?
I can wait here.
They're refusing to do that.
I don't often stay up late at night.
I convinced Tom not to go there by himself.
I have a girlfriend already.
I tried to remain calm.
How do you fix something like that?
I can drive now.
There's no way that'll work.
I have to get out of this situation.
Tom wouldn't be able do that any better.
I have friends in Australia.
I thought we were done.
How do you know if you were hacked?
I came too late.
There were boxes everywhere.
I haven't been on a date in so long.
Tom has many friends who can speak French.
I knocked on the door again.
I think I do good work.
How do you know that was the cause?
I came prepared.
The movie is about to start.
I haven't been to the gym this week.
That man told me his name was Tom Jackson.
I know you'll agree with me.
I sometimes exaggerate.
How do you plan on paying for this?
I came in first.
The class is about to start.
I hope you're not trying to fool us.
Perhaps I ought to tell Tom what happened.
I may have to give a speech.
I seldom win arguments.
How do you relax in your free time?
I called a taxi.
That's not impossible to do.
I knew that this would happen again.
I'm so glad you and Tom get along so well.
I never wore that hat again.
I seldom eat breakfast.
How do you think that made me feel?
I burped loudly.
That won't happen overnight.
I look young compared to my husband.
I'll never forgive myself for hitting Tom.
I sing pretty well, I think.
I promise I'll do that.
How do you think we should do this?
I burned myself.
That wasn't what I expected.
I never was much of a tennis player.
I wonder if Tom could do anything to help.
I think I was too ambitious.
I often walk to school.
How does Boston compare to Chicago?
I brought a pie.
That isn't likely to happen.
I never was very good at basketball.
I thought maybe I shouldn't tell Tom that.
I think I'd like to do that.
I occasionally do that.
How does this affect your business?
I broke the law.
Someone's waiting to see us.
I stepped aside to let the men pass.
I stopped Tom from doing something stupid.
I was Mr. Jackson's student.
I never work on Sunday.
How far is it to the zoo from here?
I broke the cup.
Please wait a little longer.
I thought we could do that together.
I just don't think what Tom did was right.
I was cute when I was a kid.
I never was successful.
How hot is it going to be tomorrow?
I bet on horses.
Please don't ask me to sing.
I tried the door, but it was locked.
I don't think that what Tom did was right.
I was dirty when I got home.
I never was overweight.
How is the situation different now?
I behaved badly.
Our vacation is almost over.
I wouldn't be opposed to doing that.
I don't believe Tom will ever get married.
I won't make dinner for you.
I never was optimistic.
How likely is this to happen again?
I began working.
Our house was built in 2013.
I'm already pretty good at swimming.
Did you notice how tired Tom looked today?
I would leave if I were you.
I need to take it easy.
How long have you been a carpenter?
I began running.
Mary won the beauty contest.
I'm awfully sorry I've made you cry.
Tom says that I always talk about myself.
I'd like to try that myself.
I might be there early.
How long is your commute to school?
I ate the salad.
Mary was wearing a fur coat.
I'm glad that your arm isn't broken.
Tom has no intention of marrying anybody.
I'll find out what happened.
I like basketball, too.
How many employees have you fired?
I ate an orange.
Mary wants to be an actress.
I'm often accused of being arrogant.
Tom and Mary are in love with each other.
I'll leave Boston on Monday.
I just love basketball.
How much are they going to pay you?
I ate all of it.
Mary still plays with dolls.
I'm the only person who can do this.
That sounds like something Tom might say.
I'm not in Boston right now.
I hope I wasn't boring.
How much can you make mowing lawns?
I arrived first.
Mary is prettier than Alice.
I've already been to the bank today.
Neither Tom nor Mary knows how to do that.
I'm not sure what'll change.
I had a cold last week.
How much cash do you usually carry?
I arrived early.
Mary is a good-looking girl.
I've already called for a tow truck.
I've already given Tom what he asked for.
I'm pleased with the result.
I don't read very fast.
How much did you really understand?
I almost smiled.
Mary has a very pretty face.
I've already decided not to do that.
I'd like for you to do something for Tom.
I can wait if you want me to.
I don't need this much.
How much is this costing taxpayers?
I've done time.
Mary had her handbag stolen.
I've already decided who to go with.
I thought you liked Tom better than John.
I can't do that without help.
I do a lot of swimming.
How much longer do we have to wait?
I've been sick.
Make sure you lock the door.
I've never needed to do this before.
I never would've asked Tom that question.
I can't do this without help.
I can't sell my things.
How much longer do we need to wait?
I've been hurt.
It's definitely frustrating.
I already have enough to worry about.
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I could've done a better job.
I can't open this door.
How much storage space do you need?
I've been away.
It's a school, not a prison.
I always know how to get things done.
Tom said that he thought I looked happy.
I did what everyone else did.
I can't answer you now.
How new are your windshield wipers?
I'm vulnerable.
It may be snowing in Boston.
I came home earlier than usual today.
Tom said he didn't have time to do that.
I don't need this much money.
I brought this with me.
How often do you buy bottled water?
I'm very tough.
Have you changed the filter?
I can't believe you really said that.
Tom planted these trees a long time ago.
I don't need this much stuff.
I bought a down jacket.
How reliant are you on electricity?
I'm very messy.
Everyone knows you did that.
I can't tell you about what happened.
Tom is so different from John, isn't he?
I don't often wear corduroys.
I ate my lunch earlier.
How soon can we get away from here?
I'm very blunt.
Does this make sense to you?
I don't believe you really mean that.
That sounds like something Tom might do.
I don't think I'm unbeatable.
I always do the dishes.
How will we know what has happened?
I'm still sick.
Can you handle the pressure?
I don't care how much money you make.
I've already told Tom what I plan to do.
I don't think I'm very funny.
I always carry a knife.
Is that man over there your friend?
I'm scared now.
Are your eyes troubling you?
I don't have to do that until Monday.
I've already explained the rules to Tom.
I don't think I'm very petty.
I almost never do that.
It's dangerous for us to stay here.
I'm recovering.
Are you planning to do that?
I have enough to worry about already.
I told Tom it was OK for him to do that.
I don't think we can do that.
I almost died that day.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
I'm quite weak.
You'd better make one, too.
I have some friends who want to help.
I just called Tom, but he didn't answer.
I fried an egg for breakfast.
I've already resigned.
Mary is more attractive than Alice.
I'm quite tall.
Why are they staring at us?
I hope you're not trying to cheat us.
I haven't yet read the message from Tom.
I guess it might be possible.
I'm your new neighbor.
Mary wore a red ribbon in her hair.
I'm quite rich.
Who should we speak to now?
I knew you would do something stupid.
I have already spoken to Tom about that.
I hardly ever have headaches.
I'm sure I'll succeed.
Mary's wedding dress was beautiful.
I'm quite poor.
What time did you get here?
I knocked over the vase and broke it.
I gave a speech at Tom's birthday party.
I have everything I need now.
I'm so glad I met you.
Maybe that law needs to be changed.
I'm quite lazy.
What does this mean to you?
I like to complain about the weather.
I don't think Tom would let you do that.
I have never skipped a class.
I'm really very happy.
I'm pretty old.
What did you do about that?
I often take a walk before breakfast.
I didn't understand everything Tom said.
I haven't done that in years.
I'm not yet convinced.
There's nothing else we need to do.
I'm on the job.
We've got three games left.
I put a spoonful of sugar in the tea.
We had a welcome party for Tom Jackson.
I hope nobody feels that way.
I'm not always honest.
Things aren't always this exciting.
I'm not stoned.
We're not afraid of anyone.
I retired when I was sixty years old.
Tom wrote back that wouldn't be coming.
I knew I had something to do.
I'm irritated by that.
We consider that a serious problem.
I'm not family.
We're both very happy here.
I seldom drink coffee in the evening.
Tom would do almost anything for money.
I may not come to your party.
I'm going to be there.
We have a lot things on sale today.
I'm just a boy.
We're both very frightened.
I thought the concert was quite good.
Tom has never told a story in his life.
I now know why that happened.
I'm already in Boston.
We've been busy doing other things.
I'm in my room.
We're all praying for rain.
I thought the price was kind of high.
Tom and Mary walked to school together.
I seldom go hiking by myself.
I wore this yesterday.
You're pretty stubborn, aren't you.
I'm here again.
We'll be leaving on Monday.
I was just about to start doing that.
It was your bicycle that I sold to Tom.
I think I did OK on the test.
I won't sing with you.
All I want to do right now is sleep.
I'm growing up.
We got off to a good start.
I was just pretending I was sleeping.
I'm doing everything I can to help Tom.
I think perhaps I'll do that.
I won't give you that.
Are you planning on having children?
I'm going deaf.
We don't know who did that.
I'd like to do that with you someday.
I told Tom not to tell Mary about that.
I think we'll always be here.
I was just going home.
Do you know those people over there?
I'm frustrated.
We didn't have any warning.
I'll do whatever I can to assist you.
I thought you liked Tom better than me.
I was advised not to do that.
I was inside, waiting.
Do you think what I did was helpful?
I'm displeased.
We didn't change the rules.
I'll do whatever it takes to succeed.
I suppose Tom has changed a great deal.
I was happy with the results.
I tried to be evasive.
Doing that would've been ridiculous.
I'm busy again.
We couldn't go any further.
I'll do whatever it takes to survive.
Does Tom speak French better than Mary?
I was popular in high school.
I think nobody's home.
How are we going to cross the river?
I'm bummed out.
We can't have it both ways.
I'm determined to do the right thing.
What's the real reason Tom isn't here?
I was very sick at that time.
I think I was amusing.
How are you promoting your business?
I'm being sued.
We can't give you anything.
I'm the one who paid for the tickets.
Tom told Mary not to worry about that.
I don't wear a tie every day.
I think I saw a ghost.
How can we do this faster next time?
I'm badly hurt.
This won't fix the problem.
I've been accused of being dishonest.
Tom said he thought I was charismatic.
I won't answer that question.
I seldom go to church.
How come this never happened before?
I'm back early.
This is my first time here.
I've rented a room not far from here.
Tom said he thought I seemed confused.
I won't be paid until Monday.
I seldom drink coffee.
How could anyone disagree with that?
I'm back again.
This is just what I needed.
I always wanted to be rich and famous.
Tom never puts raisins in his oatmeal.
I wonder how much that costs.
I read a lot of books.
How could that possibly help people?
I'm an outcast.
This is highly recommended.
I believe in always telling the truth.
Tom is a better musician than Mary is.
I work there for three years.
I never walk barefoot.
How could you do that to an old man?
I'm an athlete.
Think carefully about this.
I couldn't eat everything on my plate.
Tom always does what needs to be done.
I'd like you to do something.
I never walk anywhere.
How could you let them kill our son?
I'm an amateur.
They may be busy right now.
I didn't arrive until it was too late.
I was kind of surprised Tom said that.
I'm always happy to help out.
I love Mary's perfume.
How do you deal with writer's block?
I'm an acrobat.
These are half price today.
I didn't deserve the punishment I got.
I really must speak to Tom about that.
I'm fairly talented, I think.
I hope I can help you.
How do you find time for everything?
I'm already up.
That's part of the problem.
I didn't know it was wrong to do this.
I never would've asked Tom to do that.
I'm feeling a lot better now.
I hardly ever do that.
How do you find time to write music?
I'm a weakling.
Pets can be very expensive.
I didn't like the way the movie ended.
I might try to talk to Tom about that.
I'm going to propose to Mary.
I got dressed quickly.
How do you know the door was locked?
I'm a teenager.
Perhaps I was a bit greedy.
I didn't think that this would happen.
I have no intention of voting for Tom.
I'm in love with you already.
I don't have a butler.
How do you relax in your spare time?
I'm a survivor.
Nobody knows what happened.
I do hope everything will go smoothly.
I don't know how many cousins Tom has.
I'm not interested in sports.
I do a lot of cooking.
How do you think we should fix this?
I'm a southpaw.
Mary makes her own clothes.
I don't do that as often as I used to.
I carried Tom upstairs to his bedroom.
I'm not leaving anytime soon.
I didn't wait in line.
How fast can you drive on this road?
I'm a sculptor.
Mary is wearing high heels.
I don't have any friends in Australia.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
I'm not sure what's going on.
I can't do that today.
How good a baseball player were you?
I'm a romantic.
Mary is tall and beautiful.
I guess I have no choice but to fight.
Did Tom come to the party with anyone?
I'm pretty excited right now.
I can't back down now.
How has getting married changed you?
I'm a reporter.
Mary is knitting a sweater.
I have a map in the glove compartment.
Can't you suggest something else, Tom?
I'm pretty outgoing, I think.
I can run really fast.
How has that helped you in this job?
I'm a preacher.
Mary is a really nice lady.
I haven't had to pay for anything yet.
You must do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm quite good at doing that.
I can already do that.
How long can we continue doing this?
I'm a newcomer.
Let's go down to the river.
I haven't really thought about it yet.
We have to get ready for Tom's visit.
I've got to start doing that.
I came here by myself.
How long does it take to walk there?
I'm a minister.
It's definitely a nuisance.
I hope that doesn't ever happen again.
Tom's father died when he was a baby.
I've learned a lot of things.
I believe I was wrong.
How long has your roof been leaking?
I'm a mechanic.
It's becoming more popular.
I know that you don't want to do that.
Tom wanted to name his daughter Mary.
I've learned from my mistake.
I believe I was right.
How many countries have you been to?
I'm a magician.
It's a dangerous situation.
I never want to talk about this again.
Tom wanted to know what was going on.
I've seen this movie already.
I'm tired of reading.
How many hot dogs do you sell a day?
I'm a handyman.
It was very cold in Boston.
I never was very interested in sports.
Tom told Mary not to worry about him.
I always get up at six-thirty.
I'm the bashful type.
How many jobs do you have right now?
I'm a good boy.
It was extremely difficult.
I seldom feel like doing that anymore.
Tom isn't as old as I thought he was.
I always sit in the front row.
I'm still doing that.
How much are you going to charge us?
I'm a gardener.
It happened really quickly.
I seldom read books written in French.
Tom is the one who actually did that.
I always try to avoid trouble.
I'm proud of my work.
How much damage did the storm cause?
I'm a fugitive.
It feels weird not working.
I started eating before everyone else.
Tom is the former owner of this club.
I can't communicate with them.
I'm hardly ever late.
How much did you spend last weekend?
I'm a designer.
Is it difficult to do that?
I stayed awake for as long as I could.
Tom and Mary rented John's old house.
I'm going to save it.
How much do they pay you to do that?
I'm a crusader.
Hot dogs are three dollars.
I was a spy when I was in my thirties.
Maybe I shouldn't have told Tom that.
I deeply regret that decision.
I'm finished already.
How much life insurance do you need?
I'm a botanist.
Don't let anybody fool you.
I was kind of surprised you said that.
I'd like you to do something for Tom.
I didn't go jogging yesterday.
I'm already standing.
How much money have you made so far?
I'm a bookworm.
Do you think I look strong?
I was the first one here this morning.
I guess I'll wait till Tom gets here.
I didn't know what that meant.
I'm already a father.
How often do you use your telephone?
I'm a believer.
Do you know the bus driver?
I wonder how much you know about this.
I don't think Tom would've done that.
I didn't know what to believe.
I'll let you do that.
How often should you wash your hair?
I write poetry.
Do you ever wear a bow tie?
I'll be out of town until next Monday.
I can't believe Tom really said that.
I didn't want to shoot my dog.
I won't sing tonight.
How should this plan be carried out?
I work indoors.
You must be really hungry.
I'm getting tired of your complaining.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that.
I don't have to do that today.
I won't eat anything.
How well do you know your neighbors?
I wore a hoody.
Why do we have to go home?
I'm too old to do something like that.
Tom wasn't the one who gave me that.
I don't like punk rock at all.
I wish I were famous.
How will we get this done by Monday?
I won't starve.
Where do you go from here?
I've already seen that movie, I think.
Tom was never very friendly to Mary.
I don't think I'm a bad loser.
I went out by myself.
How will we overcome these problems?
I won't eat it.
What's your cousin's name?
I've met some interesting people here.
Tom was just as excited as Mary was.
I don't want to die in prison.
I wasn't too worried.
How worried should we be about that?
I won the game.
What do you want for that?
I've probably already seen that movie.
Tom said he thought I was insincere.
I had intended to go shopping.
I was wrong to do it.
How would you handle this situation?
I went outside.
What do you suppose it is?
I've told you that many times already.
Tom never was very friendly to Mary.
I had to wait for a long time.
I was on TV recently.
How would your friends describe you?
I wasn't fired.
We've fixed all the leaks.
I accidentally shot myself in the foot.
Tom didn't know it was wrong to lie.
I have no choice but to fight.
I was being truthful.
If you hadn't done that, I would've.
I wasn't armed.
We waited a little longer.
I always wear sunglasses, even indoors.
I hope you'll have a good time, Tom.
I have no pain, which is good.
I tried to look busy.
It took me a long time to get ready.
I was worn out.
We need to take a picture.
I bought one of those a few years back.
Don't you think Tom would like this?
I have no plans at this point.
I tried to keep warm.
It's not as cold here as I expected.
I was very sad.
We must hope for the best.
I could do this if I had a little help.
Tom wants to play tennis with Mary.
I have to give it back anyway.
I thought I was done.
Let's go out for a drink after work.
I was unharmed.
We might do that tomorrow.
I could refuse to do that, but I won't.
Tom said he'd do anything for Mary.
I have to make a note of that.
I think I'm likeable.
Perhaps I'm sometimes too secretive.
I was truthful.
We hope you enjoy it here.
I feel exactly the same way about that.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I haven't been there in years.
I seldom eat seafood.
The murder weapon hasn't been found.
I was the star.
We have to do it together.
I haven't been on a date since October.
Tom is a better musician than Mary.
I haven't done much this week.
I seldom eat at home.
There's no way I can lose this time.
I was selected.
We have to deal with that.
I never wanted to go swimming as a kid.
Tom has been working in the garden.
I haven't eaten meat in years.
I refused to do that.
There's nothing else we can do here.
I was relieved.
We don't want to get lost.
I often leave dirty dishes in the sink.
Tom had no intention of going away.
I hope it doesn't ever happen.
I need some rest now.
You must be really tired and hungry.
I was punished.
We do all sorts of things.
I slept for three hours this afternoon.
Tom doesn't want to move to Boston.
I hope my prediction is wrong.
I may need your help.
Doing this makes me feel young again.
I was punctual.
We didn't have to do that.
I thought we would be in Boston by now.
I've never borrowed money from Tom.
I hope nobody feels like that.
I like to tell jokes.
Don't worry so much about the future.
I was promoted.
Things are well organized.
I took a thirty-minute nap after lunch.
I've already explained that to Tom.
I hope that didn't offend you.
I like teaching, too.
Have I said anything that isn't true?
I was prepared.
They've made improvements.
I try to never complain about the food.
I'll wait here until Tom gets here.
I hope they catch the shooter.
I let everybody down.
Have you finally finished doing that?
I was poisoned.
They wouldn't let me sing.
I was healthy up until three years ago.
I was the one who made Tom do that.
I hope they get it fixed soon.
I insisted on paying.
How are they going to get that fixed?
I was outraged.
They walked home together.
I was hoping we could do that together.
I was surprised that Tom said that.
I hope this advice is helpful.
I have a lot of cats.
How are they going to prove anything?
I was obedient.
They didn't want me there.
I wasn't ready to do that at that time.
I think Tom wouldn't be happy here.
I just can't thank you enough.
I failed three times.
How are you dealing with the problem?
I was left out.
That's not worth the risk.
I wish you could've been there with me.
I sometimes help Tom in the garden.
I just didn't want to do that.
I do a lot of skiing.
How are you enjoying the trip so far?
I was laid off.
That's not worth our time.
I'll do whatever it takes to stay here.
I owe Tom a real debt of gratitude.
I just didn't want to give up.
I cut my hair myself.
How are you going to cook the turkey?
I was inspired.
That's just how I like it.
I'm planning to go skiing next weekend.
I never told Tom much about myself.
I just don't have enough time.
I can't tell you why.
How are you going to pay for college?
I was in agony.
That's just an accusation.
I've already told you that three times.
I might be able to do that for Tom.
I just don't have that choice.
I've found the leak.
How can I be sure I'm doing it right?
I was homesick.
That was very scary to me.
I've been dealing with major back pain.
I know both Tom and Mary very well.
I just don't think it's right.
I've been fortunate.
How can I delete photos from my iPad?
I was gullible.
That never occurred to me.

How can you tell which one is a fake?
I was ecstatic.
Please don't make me sing.
I've never seen Mary this upset before.
I had a long talk with Tom tonight.
I just wish I could get a job.
I'm not that naïve.
How could I expect you to understand?
I was discreet.
Our team is likely to win.
I almost always eat breakfast by myself.
I found my bike behind Tom's house.

I'm not eating that.

I'm not a good cook.
How did you acquire that information?
I was abducted.
Mary is prettier than you.
I don't care what people think about me.
I don't like the way Tom does that.
I knew that this would happen.
I'm not a barbarian.
How did you do that without any help?
I wanted money.
Mary is a wonderful woman.
I don't know anyone who lives in Boston.
I didn't like the way Tom did that.
I knew you would do something.
I'm no longer bored.
How did you get started in wrestling?
I wanted a job.
Let's not eat out tonight.
I don't know anyone who plays the banjo.

I want updates.
Let's not do this anymore.
I don't like riding a bicycle very much.
Are you going to break up with Tom?
I know I was wrong about that.
I'm a bit skeptical.
How did you know who to give that to?

Let's have lunch together.
I forgot to give you back your umbrella.
Tom thinks that Mary will do that.
I know better than to do that.
I'll dance with you.

I walk quickly.
It's difficult to do that.
I forgot to return your umbrella to you.

I know it was partly my fault.
I watch a lot of TV.
How do you decide what songs to play?
I took the job.
It's difficult to analyze.
I got better after taking that medicine.

I know you're being sarcastic.
I was too ambitious.
How do you enforce these regulations?
I took a break.
It's been cloudy all week.
I haven't eaten any meat in a long time.
Tom didn't ask any more questions.
I left Boston three years ago.
I tried to stand up.
How do you prove something like that?
I talked a lot.
It wasn't really so scary.
I haven't had a vacation in a long time.
I was like Tom when I was his age.

I studied hard.
It was pretty spectacular.
I knew I had to do something about that.

It was a great experience.
I need to find a way to get out of here.
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom.
I must agree with you on this.
I seldom skip meals.
How have your reading habits changed?
I stole a base.
Go back home to Australia.

Did you change the filter?
I was just trying to do the right thing.
I never asked Tom what he thought.
I seldom visit Boston anymore.
I never was unlucky.
How long do you plan to keep working?
I should relax.
All the children like you.
I would cry, too, I that happened to me.
I haven't seen much of Tom lately.
I spoke as quietly as I could.
I needed more money.
How long have you lived in Australia?
I should be OK.
You're half an hour late.
I'd like for you to do something for me.
I don't know anyone who likes Tom.
I stepped back from the cliff.
I might not do that.
How long will it take you to do that?
I scream a lot.
You won't mind, will you?
I'd like to do that as soon as possible.
I always let Tom do what he wants.
I think I'm going to die soon.
I may still do that.

I have news for you.
How much did you pay for those shoes?
I said goodbye.
What do you plan to sell?
I'm not opposed to going back to Boston.
Tom told me all about his family.
I think you did it on purpose.
I drove myself home.
How much difference can one man make?
I rented a car.
What do we need that for?
I'm pretty sure I can do this by myself.
Tom thought Mary worked for John.
I thought it was kind of cool.
I don't often smile.
How much do we have to pay to get in?
I ran for help.

That was very gratifying.
I always try to wear fashionable clothes.
Tom is particularly kind to Mary.

I may not come.
Shut up and listen to me.
I can't remember what I'm supposed to do.

I was pretty happy about that.
I'm kind of sleepy.
The problem still hasn't been solved.
I love fishing.
Mary is a charming woman.
I know that you won't be able to do that.
Tom can be just as tough as Mary.
I was scared and stressed out.
I'm in a big hurry.
We're going to miss you an awful lot.
I looked at it.
Let's walk home together.
I often wear blue jeans and a blue shirt.
Tom arrived the day before I did.
I was sure I was going to die.
I'm here all alone.
Will you explain what the trouble is?
I lit the oven.
Let's not go there today.
I think the audience thought I was funny.
Tom also has a sister named Mary.
I was very busy all last week.
I'm already in bed.
Do you plan to attend today's meeting?
I lit the fuse.
Last night was very cold.

I'm glad Tom is going to college.

I'm a student here.
Don't forget to wash behind your ears.
I lit the fire.
It certainly wasn't easy.

I seldom get angry.
How can we find out what's causing it?
I like to hunt.
Do you think I look cool?
I'm only doing what I've been told to do.
You'd better see what Tom wants.
I won't listen to you anymore.
I pulled the lever.
How come we've never done this before?
I like to draw.

I'll tell you the whole story.
I hope I'll fit in.

I kept focused.
That should be possible.
I have a grandson and three granddaughters.
I didn't want to show it to Tom.
I'm not even going to comment.
I won't accept it.
How on earth could this be a surprise?
I kept driving.
That might be dangerous.
I haven't yet done what needs to be done.
I didn't talk to Tom about that.
I'm not going to be a yes man.
I was my own boss.
How soon do you expect that to happen?
I kept digging.
Thanks for posting this.

I have a ranch.
Let me help you do that.
I'm sure your parents must be proud of you.

I'm so glad you are not upset.
I love basketball.
There's no way we can do that by 2:30.
I have a radio.
It was a great surprise.
I've already been questioned by the police.
Tom took a book from the shelf.
I'm still in a state of shock.
I like the change.
There's nothing else to worried about.
I have a piano.
Is doing that difficult?
I've done everything that needs to be done.
Tom told me to be here by 2:30.
I'm still planning to do that.
I just need sleep.
This problem still needs to be solved.
I have a guest.
How's your garden doing?

I'm very sorry for my actions.
I have three DUIs.
Did you really get kicked off the team?
I hated Boston.
Everything's going well.
I didn't do what you've accused me of doing.
Tom thought of a good solution.
I've been drinking since 2:30.
I have split ends.
Do you think you'll ever go to college?
I hate running.
Don't be afraid to sing.
I didn't think that this would happen again.

I've been having a rough time.
I have short hair.
How are they going to enforce that law?
I hate jogging.

I've been working all my life.
I have brown eyes.

I've got to start working out.
I have black hair.
How can you be sure that never happens?

Tom said I was being obnoxious.
I've tried doing that already.
I have a fast car.
How can you not love someone like that?
I had jeans on.
Aren't we going do that?
I promise you that I'll never do that again.
Tom rode his bike to the store.
I've tried everything already.
I can't do it all.
How can you turn down a deal like that?
I had a choice.
Are you still on a diet?
I sometimes have trouble remembering things.
Tom put his hand over his face.
I almost never have nightmares.
I brought a salad.
How come the guys I want never want me?
I got very mad.
You're pretty stubborn.
I suppose I'll get used to it after a while.
Tom didn't give an explanation.
I always knew it was important.
I always get lost.
How common are these kinds of problems?
I got no reply.
Why would anyone leave?
I was just pretending I was enjoying myself.
That's probably what Tom meant.
I always make a mess of things.
I always eat well.
How could something like that get lost?
I got it wrong.
Why shouldn't we leave?
I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy.
I've never told Tom about that.
I always wanted to be a cowboy.
I'm stressed out.
How did the two of you meet each other?
I got it right.

I appreciate you talking to me.
I'm not that old.
How did you get that scar on your chin?
I got a tattoo.
Why aren't you cooking?
I've caused everyone enough trouble already.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
I believe the opposite is true.
I'm not that bad.
How did you know I needed one of these?
I glanced back.
Who's going to do what?
I ate all the cookies that were on the plate.
I'm glad that Tom wasn't there.
I can remember it very vividly.
I'm not so smart.
How did you know I wanted one of these?
I glanced away.
Who wouldn't want that?
I can't figure out how to say this in French.
I would like to go and see Tom.
I can't get my tractor started.
I'm not prepared.
How do things like this keep happening?
I finally left.
Who wouldn't like that?
I do my best to avoid talking about politics.
I told Tom not to believe Mary.
I can't let you do this for me.
I'm not homeless.
How do you choose which projects to do?
I felt trapped.
Where are your jackets?
I had intended to go shopping this afternoon.
I know his real name isn't Tom.
I can't really comment on that.
I'm not drinking.
How do you decide what's right for you?
I felt nothing.
When should we do that?
I hope the police catch the guy who did this.
I didn't like the way Tom sang.
I can't say any more than that.
I'm not diabetic.
How do you encourage people to do that?
I felt foolish.
What's the real reason?
I know that you don't speak French very well.
I didn't answer Tom's question.
I can't speak to you right now.
I'm not deranged.
How do you find time to do the laundry?
I felt awkward.
What's happened so far?
I never could've done this without your help.
I complained to Tom about that.
I could do that if I wanted to.
I'm not demented.
How do you prepare for a job like this?
I felt ashamed.
What'll the results be?
I received a strange phone call this morning.
I already know what Tom thinks.
I decided that was a good sign.
I'm not autistic.
How has your experience been different?
I felt amazing.
What'll the outcome be?
I spoke slowly, so everyone could understand.
Do I seem very old to you, Tom?
I did the same thing in Boston.
I'm not an angel.
How long do you think we can stay here?
I fed the pigs.
What was your strategy?
I stood in line for more than thirty minutes.
What would you have done, Tom?
I didn't do my job well enough.
I'm not a racist.
How long have you been teaching tennis?
I expect a lot.
What do you do all day?
I usually walk to school if it isn't raining.
Tom would've liked to do that.
I didn't know this at the time.
I'm not a prince.
How many bands will be playing tonight?
I eat anything.
What did we do with it?
I want to become someone you can be proud of.
Tom wants to come and see you.
I didn't really think about it.
I'm not a madman.
How many inches did you grow last year?
I drank a shot.
What did the doctor do?
I'll do whatever I can to protect all of you.
Tom said that I was too noisy.
I didn't sleep much that night.
I'm not a killer.
How many of us have actually done that?
I drank a beer.
We're all pretty tired.
I'll do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.
Tom said that I sounded tired.
I didn't think I was that good.
I'm not a farmer.
How many of you don't have an umbrella?
I did it wrong.
We really enjoyed that.
I'll do whatever it takes to get my son back.
Tom said that I can't come in.
I didn't want to offend anyone.
I won't bite you.
How many people have I insulted so far?
I cut the tape.
We might as well leave.
I'll do whatever it takes to get what I want.
Tom must be expecting company.
I won't back off.
How many times are we going to do this?
I cut the rope.
We aren't finished yet.
I'll do whatever it takes to stay where I am.
Tom is better known than Mary.
I don't agree with that at all.
I waved the flag.
How much can you make delivering pizza?
I created this.
Was I supposed to sing?
I'm not as young as the rest of my teammates.
Tom has improved a great deal.
I don't agree with that myself.
I wasn't pleased.
How much does it cost to fly to Boston?
I changed that.
Those were tough times.
I've finally gotten used to living on a boat.
They say Tom is very peculiar.
I don't believe we can do that.
I was mesmerized.
How much longer do you want me to wait?
I changed jobs.
They might not do that.
I always eat something before going to school.
Perhaps Tom has fallen asleep.
I don't care how much you make.
I was in trouble.
How much more of this do we need to do?
I can't say no.
They all made mistakes.
I didn't arrive until it was already too late.
I seldom speak to Tom anymore.
I don't care who wins the game.
I was in a fight.
How much oil has actually been spilled?
I can't refuse.
That happened long ago.
I don't have any friends who can speak French.
I know his middle name is Tom.
I don't care who wins the race.
I was hypnotized.
How much do we actually have to pay?
I can't decide.
Our plans have changed.
I don't want to go upstairs alone in the dark.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
I don't care who you voted for.
I was badly hurt.
How often do you change your passwords?
I can run fast.
Nobody is stopping you.
I never wanted to go there in the first place.
I discussed the plan with Tom.
I don't charge for my services.
I wanted revenge.
How often do you check your smartphone?
I can go first.
Life is difficult here.
I should come to Boston to visit you sometime.
How did you and Tom get along?
I don't feel frustrated at all.
I turned the key.
How old were you when you were adopted?
I brought that.
Let me help you choose.
I think we should stop doing what we're doing.
I don't feel the least bit sad.
I tried to smile.
How would you feel if you lost $30,000?
I bought a dog.
Leave the windows open.
I'll do whatever it takes to feed my children.
What are Tom's children like?
I don't follow politics at all.
I sure am hungry.
It's time for me to tell you the truth.
I bought a car.
It's not too expensive.
I'll do whatever it takes to get my kids back.
Tom was too excited to sleep.
I don't have a house in Boston.
I stood up again.
Let's see if we can get some work done.
I began to run.
It wasn't an easy race.
I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.
Tom said I looked a bit pale.
I don't have a lot of problems.
I stifled a grin.
What job are you going to tackle first?
I began to eat.
It was pretty exciting.
I go jogging before breakfast almost every day.
Tom must be somewhere around.
I don't have a phone right now.
I sliced the ham.
When was last time you washed your car?
I began pacing.
It sure is windy today.
I haven't yet deleted all the duplicate photos.
Tom meant it as a compliment.
I don't have a problem with it.
I sipped my wine.
Apparently, it's not too early to apply.
I began crying.
How do you really feel?
I see no reason why you shouldn't go to Boston.
Their names are Tom and Mary.
I don't have to be nice to you.
I shut the trunk.
How am I going to get this accomplished?
I arrived late.
Here's the translation.
I still have the first letter you ever sent me.
It's time for Tom to go home.
I don't like dancing very much.
I seldom do that.
How are we supposed to fix these issues?
I arrived last.
Go put some clothes on.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
I won't be able to catch Tom.
I don't want to move to Boston.
I sat very still.
How are you going to deal with this one?
I agreed to go.
Doors open at 2:30 p.m.
I thought you said we weren't going to be here.
I wasn't sure what Tom meant.
I have to do everything myself.
I sat on the bed.
How can I avoid making the same mistake?
I've resigned.
Do you plan to do that?
I usually order the cheapest thing on the menu.
I think Tom agrees with Mary.
I haven't had any problems yet.
I sat down again.
How can so many things go wrong at once?
I'm well paid.
Come visit us sometime.
I want to go to Boston just as badly as you do.
I parked my car behind Tom's.
I hope I don't starve to death.
I sat at the bar.
How can we live longer, healthier lives?
I'm very thin.
Can you jump that high?
I was advised to stay out of that part of town.
I lived with Tom for a while.
I hope we'll get together soon.
I said it was OK.
How can we put a stop to this injustice?
I'm very tall.
Both men were executed.
I wish I had enough money to buy a new bicycle.
I don't think Tom was joking.
I hope you'll have a good time.
I resigned today.
How can you be so calm about everything?
I'm very sick.
Both girls were crying.
I wonder how much time we will have to do that.
Tom said I looked beautiful.
I just have to get out of here.
I remained still.
How come nobody ever hitchhikes anymore?
I'm very rich.
Be prepared to do that.
I'll do whatever I can to make it easy for you.
Tom has worked hard all day.
I just wish I could find a job.
I remained quiet.
How come you never ask simple questions?
I'm very fast.
You voted, didn't you?
I'll do whatever it takes to get this job done.
Tom did that all by himself.
I lit a candle so we could see.
I put on my coat.
How could you still be upset about that?
I'm unpopular.
Will you be my friend?
I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you.
I taught Tom how to do that.
I made an omelet for breakfast.
I owe you dinner.
How did you become interested in design?
I'm tone deaf.
Where's your bathroom?
I'll do whatever it takes to make things right.
I showed Tom how to do that.
I never wanted to study French.
I opened the lid.
How did you get the idea for this movie?
I'm the chief.
We should consider it.
I'll do whatever it takes to protect my family.
Tom teaches law at Harvard.
I never wore those shoes again.
I opened the box.
How did you get those scars on your arm?
I'm shivering.
We do this every year.
I'll do whatever it takes to save our marriage.
Tom said I sounded worried.
I sometimes sing in the shower.
I opened the bag.
How did you know where to look for that?
I'm paralyzed.
There's no water left.
I'm not as busy this month as I was last month.
Tom said I looked stunning.
I sometimes sleep on the couch.
I never was rich.
How did you make the decision to retire?
I'm on a roll.
There's no money left.
I'm sure you understand why we have to do this.
Tom said I looked horrible.
I stayed there for a long time.
I never was poor.
How do you keep cats out of your garden?
I'm off today.
That's still not true.
I've been singing a lot of folk songs recently.
Tom said I looked confused.
I stayed there for three hours.
I never was neat.
Is there something you don't understand?
I'm not weird.
That sounds expensive.
I've caused everybody a lot of trouble already.
Is that man over there Tom?
I think I was wrong about that.
I might get lost.
Is this the program you wanted to watch?
I'm not tough.
Somebody's in trouble.
I didn't know we were supposed to be quiet here.
I stole something from Tom.
I think we'll have a good team.
I might be right.
Let's sit next to each other on the bus.
I'm not petty.
Please say that again.
I don't know how I could've made such a mistake.
Tom says he can't do that.
I told Mary that I loved her.
I looked outside.
Please put this back where you found it.
I'm not naked.
Please come back soon.
I don't think I'll be able to eat anything else.
Tom says Mary is a genius.
I used to play piano at a club.
I loaded the van.
That's what I meant to discuss with you.
I'm no genius.
Mary is a brave woman.
I know Mary is pretty, but she's not very smart.
Tom said I seemed shocked.
I walked all the way to Boston.
I live there now.
There are a lot of things I need to buy.
I'm moving on.
Let's keep doing this.
I looked back to see if anyone was following me.
Tom said I seemed puzzled.
I was a waiter for a few years.
I liked the idea.
There are a lot of things I want to buy.
I'm moving in.
How deep is this pool?
I might need this again, so don't throw it away.
Tom said I seemed nervous.
I was hoping you would help me.
I kept whistling.
There's a law that allows us to do that.
I'm just fine.
Everyone's interested.
I really think you should stop drinking so much.
Tom said I seemed excited.
I went downtown this afternoon.
I kept shoveling.
Would you like to come with us tomorrow?
I'm improving.
Don't leave me behind.
I recommend that you don't go there by yourself.
Tom said I seemed annoyed.
I went to bed early last night.
I kept screaming.
Do you plan on attending today's meeting?
I'm happy now.
Are your eyes hurting?
I think I should refer you to another therapist.
Tom said I looked unhappy.
I won't be busy this afternoon.
I just ate lunch.
How many times have you done that so far?
I'm giving up.
Are you still thirsty?
I think it'd be better if you didn't drink that.
Tom said I looked stunned.
I wonder how heavy that box is.
I hit the target.
How many times have you done this so far?
I'm from here.
We might not do that.
I think we still need to work on this some more.
Tom said I looked shocked.
I'd rather walk home by myself.
I hit a home run.
It'll take a while for the cement to dry.
I'm flustered.
They may not be home.
I use to never worry about how much things cost.
Tom said I looked serious.
I'll be coming with my brother.
I have wavy hair.
Please don't forget to bring a sandwich.
I'm delighted.
They just ignored me.
I want to thank you for what you've done for us.
Tom said I looked relaxed.
I'm concentrating on something.
I have seniority.
That isn't likely to happen anytime soon.
I'm coming in.
That's the hard part.
I'll already be asleep by the time you get here.
Tom said I looked puzzled.
I'm feeling a lot better today.
I have long legs.
That's not likely to happen anytime soon.
I'm back home.
People say I'm obese.
I'll do whatever I can to help you get that job.
Tom said I looked pleased.
I'm glad they caught the thief.
I have long hair.
Things are changing so fast it scares me.
I'm at school.
Maybe we should quit.
I'll do whatever it takes to correct my mistake.
Tom said I looked healthy.
I'm not interested in that job.
I have flat feet.
We all seem to be getting on pretty well.
I'm angry now.
Mary isn't beautiful.
I'll do whatever it takes to get you to love me.
Tom said I looked furious.
I'm not really sure what it is.
I have dark hair.
We need to reform our immigration system.
I'm an intern.
It's easy to do that.
I'm sure I can find something to complain about.
Tom said I looked annoyed.
I'm not talking to you anymore.
I have arthritis.
Do you really think you're better than me?
I'm an ex-con.
It sure is hot today.
I'm worried about what other people might think.
Tom is a very likable guy.
I'm sure someone was just here.
I have a new job.
Let's see if we can get this done by 2:30.
I'm a widower.
Do I seem old to you?
I do hope there'll be people I know at the party.
Tom has many friends here.
I'm the one who has to do that.
I have a new car.
That isn't the only thing that worries me.
I'm a veteran.
Can we talk with you?
I don't think I should go out on a day like this.
Tom does that really well.
I'm the one who washed the car.
I have a license.
That's not worth the price they're asking.
I'm a trucker.
Are you still single?
I don't understand why you like baseball so much.
I'm one of Tom's teachers.
I think that that won't work.
I have a hot tub.
We can't afford to make any more mistakes.
I'm a surgeon.
You've paid already.
I thought the prices at that store were too high.
I'm one of Tom's brothers.
I've already washed the dishes.
I have a fake ID.
You're not afraid to sleep alone, are you?
I'm a soldier.
Why should we leave?
I'll do whatever it takes to keep you next to me.
I'm Tom's younger brother.
I've been doing this for years.
I had a good job.
Has anyone ever told you anything about me?
I'm a skeptic.
Why did you stab me?
I'll do whatever it takes to protect my children.
I sat at the bar with Tom.
I almost forgot to pay the rent.
I got very drunk.
Have you ever been up in a hot air balloon?
I'm a regular.
Who's idea was that?
I'll do whatever it takes to protect what's mine.
I know his name isn't Tom.
I already know a lot about that.
I got very angry.
How did you expect me to know it was wrong?
I'm a refugee.
What's the big fuss?
I'm interested in learning how to play the banjo.
His name isn't really Tom.
I always do things the same way.
I got up at 6:30.
If you don't hurry, we're going to be late.
I'm a redneck.
What's on your iPod?
I'm not as drunk now as the last time you saw me.
Even Tom didn't know that.
I always get home at about 6:00.
I got on the bus.
Let me help you choose which dress to wear.
I'm a realist.
What's next for you?
I didn't know we were supposed to be here by 2:30.
What does Tom do all day?
I always leave for work at 8:00.
I got in the car.
No matter what happens, I'll stay with you.
I'm a psychic.
What's my next step?
I didn't think there was anybody I knew in Boston.
Tom says I'm very stingy.
I always wanted to study French.
I got in the cab.
That's not likely to happen in my lifetime.
I'm a plumber.
What's left to lose?
I know that you don't want to do that by yourself.
Tom says I look like you.
I always worry about everything.
I found the leak.
There's no way you can do that by yourself.
I'm a painter.
What'll you live on?
I must hurry back home before my mother misses me.
I asked the same question again.
I figured it out.
They kept me waiting for over half an hour.
I'm a gymnast.
We've already voted.
I often eat things that my doctor tells me not to.
Tom said I looked scared.
I can easily wait till tomorrow.
I felt all alone.
This well is the deepest well in this area.
I'm a florist.
We must work harder.
I thought I told you I didn't want you to be here.
Tom said I looked pretty.
I can't go into too much detail.
I fell backwards.
We'll have plenty of time to do that later.
I'm a dreamer.
That'll be possible.
I thought I told you not to sing so late at night.
Tom said I looked hungry.
I can't paint as well as you do.
I fed the horses.
We're going to have an interesting evening.
I'm a dentist.
Sorry, I was a jerk.
I thought it might be fun to eat out for a change.
Tom didn't look offended.
I can't play with you right now.
I drank too much.
We've been lucky that no one has been hurt.
I'm a blogger.
Please don't go yet.
I'll do whatever it takes to make you proud of me.
Tom did that really well.
I can't remember how to do this.
I did well today.
We've been together for almost three years.
I'm a big guy.
Please be my friend.
I've already done everything you've told me to do.
Tom did that all himself.
I can't say much more right now.
I complain a lot.
Do you know where we could get one of those?
I'll go alone.
My wife is a lawyer.
I've been wanting to do this for a very long time.
Tom badly needs our help.
I can't see any need to do that.
I closed the lid.
It looks like you've gained a little weight.
I wore gloves.
Let's go over there.
I've been wanting to learn French for a long time.
I'm one of Tom's sisters.
I can't see the need to do that.
I can't swim yet.
It's not as hot here as I expected it to be.
I wore a mask.
Let's begin at 2:30.
I've finally gotten used to living here in Boston.
I'm Tom's younger sister.
I can't wait until I have a kid.
I can't hurt you.
Mary is just as beautiful as Alice, I think.
I won't budge.
It's still not over.
I don't have enough money to buy everything I need.
I'm Tom's French teacher.
I can't wait until that happens.
I called in sick.
The man at the door didn't tell me his name.
I winked back.
It was a great idea.
I don't often make mistakes when writing in French.
I think I frightened Tom.
I don't have to do that anymore.
I broke that one.
There are a lot of things I want to ask you.
I went skiing.
How did you respond?
I don't think I'll have the time to help you today.
How old are Tom and Mary?
I don't like baseball very much.
I began coughing.
We have to be more aware of what's going on.
I went abroad.
Have we done enough?
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
You can't depend on Tom.
I don't like swimming very much.
I became nervous.
We need to be more aware of what's going on.
I wasn't sick.
Does your head ache?
I haven't even thought about what needs to be done.
Tom says I'm too skinny.
I don't often talk on the phone.
I became curious.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
I wasn't hurt.
Who's next in line?
I think it would be a good idea for you to do that.
Tom says I'm pig-headed.
I don't think I was disobedient.
I ate your candy.
There are a lot of things I need to tell you.
I was unlucky.
Who was that woman?
I used to sing professionally, but I don't anymore.
Tom says I eat too fast.
I fell down and bruised my knee.
I always says no.
There are a lot of things I want to do today.
I was unhappy.
What are the risks?
I wouldn't have done something like this last year.
Tom said I looked tired.
I hardly ever come here anymore.
I always do this.
We have to make sure people get back to work.
I was thirsty.
We're not safe yet.
I'll put the kettle on and we'll have a cup of tea.
Tom said I looked happy.
I hardly ever go shopping alone.
I almost laughed.
We need to keep getting better at everything.
I was talking.
We can't just quit.
I've already decided who to give my old bicycle to.
Tom is fatter than Mary.
I have a few gray hairs already.
I almost fainted.
You've already told me what I wanted to know.
I was stabbed.
This isn't helpful.
I always pay for dinner whenever we go out together.
Tom is an very kind man.
I have trouble making decisions.
I've just moved.
Mary is even more beautiful than I remembered.
I was spot on.
That was dangerous.
I can't afford to buy a new pair of shoes right now.
Everybody looked at Tom.
I have trouble talking to women.
I've been fired.
That's not worth the price they're asking for.
I was so busy.
My dad inspired me.
I don't understand how I could've made this mistake.
Tom says I'm too picky.
I hope someone comes to help us.
I'm your driver.
The meeting didn't last as long as I expected.
I was selfish.
Isn't that our job?
I have dozens of apps on my phone that I seldom use.
Tom says I'm too nosey.
I hope that doesn't ever happen.
I'm very strong.
The windows were already open when I got here.
I was puzzled.
Is it still Monday?
I think it'd be better if you didn't go out tonight.
Tom says I'm too bossy.
I hope they catch the kidnapper.
I'm unimpressed.
They don't sell these kinds of things anymore.
I was praying.
How common is that?
I was hoping the ice cream wouldn't melt so quickly.
Tom said I looked pale.
I never wanted to get a divorce.
I'm the copilot.
What color are you going to paint the ceiling?
I was patient.
Here are some tips.
I'll do whatever it takes to get the results I want.
Tom is nicer than Mary.
I never was a very good student.
I'm still woozy.
Everybody is hungry, so let's go ahead and eat.
I was panting.
Go clean your room.
I don't know how you can work under these conditions.
Tom has improved a lot.
I never was very good at French.
Last night, I went to sleep with the lights on.
I was on time.
Everyone's thirsty.
I just remembered that I have something I have to do.
Tom did it all himself.
I often feel drowsy after lunch.
I'm sick in bed.
Now that I'm here, everything's going to be OK.
I was on duty.
Every box was full.
I know that you won't be able to do that by yourself.
Tom always looks tired.
I often wear a black cowboy hat.
I'm seldom late.
That's what you should've done a long time ago.
I was naughty.
Doors open at 2:30.
I make it a rule never to ask a woman how old she is.
I'm Tom's older sister.
I said good morning to everyone.
I'm really sick.
What's the real reason you didn't go to Boston?
I was lenient.
Don't make excuses.
I thought you said you weren't going to smoke anymore.
I was very mean to Tom.
I should've been more assertive.
I'm really rich.
Do you remember what happened the day I met you?
I was in pain.
Don't feel too bad.
I'll do whatever I can to make things easier for you.
How's your mother, Tom?
I suggest that you dress warmly.
I'm quite timid.
Everything in the store is half price this week.
I was in love.
Don't ever give in.
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to sing tonight.
Tom swims really well.
I think I can dance pretty well.
I'm quite drunk.
First, we're all going to have something to eat.
I was in jail.
Don't believe this.
I couldn't swim as well as the other kids in my class.
Tom said I looked old.
I think we can do that tomorrow.
I'm pretty rich.
This is definitely more fun than doing homework.
I was hurting.
Don't believe them.
I don't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen.
Tom might not do that.
I was a janitor a few years ago.
I'm pigeon-toed.
You didn't need to tell me that. I already knew.
I was frantic.
Don't believe that.
I don't think there's any way I can get there on time.
Tom asked us to leave.
I was beginning to feel nervous.
I'm not winning.
Do you really think this is worth thirty dollars?
I was foolish.
Do I need to go on?
I don't understand how I could've made such a mistake.
I'm very close to Tom.
I was famous when I was younger.
I'm not violent.
That's not worth the price they're asking for it.
I was focused.
Ask for more money.
I don't want to discourage you from trying to do that.
I left after Tom left.
I was provoked into saying that.
I'm intoxicated.
There are a lot of things I have to do this week.
I was defiant.
Are you still cold?
I haven't even thought about what I might do tomorrow.
Everyone calls me Tom.
I was very rich three years ago.
I'm in mourning.
There's plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl.
I was crushed.
Are you ever happy?
I received three threatening phone calls this morning.
Why is Tom on a diet?
I was very shy when I was a kid.
I'm happier now.
Wouldn't it be nice to live in a house like that?
I was content.
Why can't we walk?
I think we would've lost if our team had played yours.
Tom says I'm selfish.
I wasn't in yesterday afternoon.
I'm getting wet.
There was a birch tree in our garden, but it died.
What'll that cost?
I wish my parents would let me stay up later at night.
Tom looked skeptical.
I won't say anything about that.
I'm coming, too.
What's the real reason you didn't want to do that?
I was bullied.
We're out of food.
I'd be grateful if you could help me move these boxes.
I helped Tom do that.
I wonder what we should do next.
I'm chewing gum.
If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.
I was beat up.
We can't use that.
I'll do whatever I can to prevent that from happening.
Tom was in an agony.
I'd love to go fishing with you.
I'm bored stiff.
It won't be long before you get used to doing this.
I was baffled.
Try to act normal.
I'll do whatever it takes to keep our family together.
I stole Tom's money.
I'll be happy when this is over.
I'm at my place.
How do you punish your children when they misbehave?
I was alarmed.
This tastes awful.
I don't think it's safe to go out at night by yourself.
We all respect Tom.
I'll be the first to admit that.
I'm an outsider.
How many times have I told you not to use that word?
I was adopted.
This isn't unique.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
I was Tom's mentor.
I'm a thirty-year-old housewife.
I'm a therapist.
You don't need to tell me what to do. I already know.
I was a loner.
The storm was bad.
I haven't done that since I graduated from high school.
I shook Tom's hand.
I'm already thirty minutes late.
I'm a sophomore.
If you fail this class, you won't be able to graduate.
I was a coach.
My plan is better.
I think we have enough time to finish doing that today.
I liked Tom's idea.
I'm coming to Boston in October.
I'm a professor.
It's so easy to be happy on a day like this, isn't it?
I wanted that.
It's not too cold.
I thought it might be fun to go to Boston this weekend.
How do I look, Tom?
I'm going to ask you a question.
I'm a paramedic.
Many people have told me that they think I'm handsome.
I wanted more.
Everyone's sleepy.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
What will Tom say?
I'm looking for a place to live.
I'm a communist.
You didn't have to tell me why because I already knew.
I want it now.
Don't harm anyone.
I'll do whatever it takes to get you back into my life.
I'm thirty minutes late already.
I'm a chauffeur.
The man waiting in the lobby wouldn't give me his name.
I want advice.
Do I look nervous?
I've asked you repeatedly not to sing so late at night.
I'm Tom's dentist.
I've already decided what to do.
I'm a cameraman.
The man waiting in the lobby wouldn't tell me his name.
I want a kiss.
What caused this?
I thought you said we weren't going to complain anymore.
I wasn't with Tom.
I've always wanted one of these.
I wouldn't quit.
The movie wasn't as interesting as I expected it to be.
I walk slowly.
We'll begin soon.
I'll do whatever it takes to keep my children in school.
How's Tom tonight?
I've been very busy all morning.
I won't say yes.
The man I was talking to earlier never told me his name.
I took a seat.
We might do that.
I can think of a lot of reasons why we shouldn't do that.
Tom isn't stingy.
I've never been late for school.
I won't be back.
There are many things that I don't understand very well.
I tire easily.
We demand change.
I started working six days a week about three months ago.
I won't help Tom.
I almost never stay up all night.
I won the match.
We have to leave now if we want to get home before dark.
I sweat a lot.
Now is my chance.
I think there's a good possibility that that will happen.
I made Tom angry.
I already have plans for tonight.
I went upstairs.
You're half a head taller than when you were here before.
I surrendered.
Nobody's singing.
I think we've got enough money to buy everything we need.
I left Tom alone.
I can't do anything without help.
I waved goodbye.
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite.
I stole a gun.
It's not too hot.
I'm afraid we must go if we want to get home before dark.
I laughed at Tom.
I caught three fish this morning.
I wasn't amused.
It would be better if we just kept doing what we're doing.
I stayed late.
It was so boring.
I don't think this is an appropriate time to discuss this.
I helped Tom win.
I confess I was wrong about that.
I was very sick.
On a hot day like this, the laundry will be dry in no time.
I stayed home.
Everyone's tired.
I have a son who goes to the same school as your daughter.
I got mad at Tom.
I did that as quickly as I could.
I was very poor.
There are a lot of things I need to do before I can go home.
I stayed cool.
Don't be so mean.
I remember when you could buy three of these for a dollar.
I gave Tom a job.
I don't think I ought to do that.
I was very late.
There are lots of things we could do to help those families.
I stayed calm.
We all felt bad.
I think there's a real good possibility of that happening.
I can't help Tom.
I get along with all my brothers.
I was shivering.
You don't need to explain it to me. I already understand it.
I stared back.
Now's my chance.
I thought I told you I didn't want you to do that anymore.
I almost hit Tom.
I hated spinach when I was a kid.
I was sent home.
If anybody had asked me if I were married, I'd have said yes.
I spoke first.
Do I look drunk?
I wore glasses when I was a teenager, but I don't anymore.
What'll Tom say?
I have friends in many countries.
I was plastered.
When I was thirteen years old, I couldn't speak French at all.
I smelled gas.
Did you get wet?
I'll do whatever it takes to keep our customers satisfied.
Tom looked hurt.
I haven't eaten steak in a while.
I was perplexed.
If anybody had asked me if I were married, I'd have said I was.
I slowed down.
What's changed?
I'm about the same weight as I was at this time last year.
I'm nice to Tom.
I hope you've enjoyed yourselves.
I was in a coma.
If you fail this class, you'll have to take it again next year.
I sleep a lot.
We deserved it.
I'm not going to tell you anything you don't already know.
I'm leaving Tom.
I know you want to quit your job.
I was depressed.
You didn't have to tell me about what happened. I already knew.
I don't drive.
Let's sit here.
I've already told you everything I think you need to know.
I'm Tom's niece.
I meant to ask you that question.
I was delirious.
You're half a head taller than you were the last time I saw you.
Everybody sang.
I've often heard of these, but I've never seen one before.
I'll assist Tom.
I might come to Boston next week.
I was courteous.
Sometimes it seems to me that you just don't really want to be here.
We had doubts.
I knew you wouldn't like the food at Chuck's Bar and Grill.
I'm Tom's twin.
I never wanted to live in Boston.
I was confident.
The best way to ruin a good cup of coffee is to put cream and sugar in it.
Dress warmly.
I'm Tom's aunt.
This game is really boring.
I'm not stupid enough to believe you.
What would I do without them?
Tom told Mary to be sure to have dinner ready at six o'clock.
It didn't take long before Tom found out about what Mary had done.
When did Tom tell you that he and Mary were going to get married?
Tom called the police and reported that his daughter was missing.
What does this have to do with what I was saying about Tom?
Tom wanted to make sure that nothing bad happened to Mary.
Tom brought his car to the repair shop to have it checked.
Tom called Mary and asked her to come over to his house.
Mary is a beautiful girl with blonde hair and blue eyes.
Tom demanded that Mary give him the money she owed him.
Unfortunately, Tom doesn't have a say in this matter.
Tom said he needs to find another way to make money.
Tom looks just like you did when you were his age.
Tom couldn't wait to see the look on Mary's face.
Tom was afraid of what might happen to his family.
Tom doesn't have any reason not to trust Mary.
When Tom found out the truth, he was furious.
Tom has something very important to tell you.
Tom wanted to find a way to fix the problem.
Tom broke down and confessed to everything.
Tom and Mary arrived in Boston before dark.
Tom asked Mary to stop what she was doing.
Were you able to convince Tom to do that?
Tom obviously likes hearing himself talk.
I don't have any reason not to trust Tom.
Tom wasn't able to work for three weeks.
Tom says he feels a little better today.
Tom leaned over and kissed Mary's cheek.
Tom could not take his eyes off of Mary.
Tom asked Mary to go to Boston with him.
This is where Tom says he wants to live.
Tom is likely to be sentenced to death.
Tom wasn't the only one who was there.
Tom told the police what had happened.
Tom said he would do anything for you.
Tom thought that Mary would kiss him.
Tom didn't believe Mary for a second.
I think that it was Tom who did this.
Everybody enjoyed watching Tom dance.
Would you like to play with us, Tom?
Tom begged Mary not to kill his dog.
Tom is likely to be famous someday.
How did you manage to convince Tom?
Did you tell Tom that Mary was here?
Tom thanked me for the compliment.
Tom didn't mean to insult anybody.
Tom dangled his feet in the water.
I'll tell Tom that you're with me.
Tom moved as quickly as he could.

I didn't notice that Tom was sitting by himself.
Tom didn't notice that Mary was sitting by herself.
I might be at home this evening, but I'm not sure yet.

I need to do more.
I've been demoted.
I can't just leave.

Who else uses them?
The fly is stuck against the window.
Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there.
One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep.
If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don't put it there.
Perhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state. Being in love shows a person who he should be.
The unhappy are egotistical, base, unjust, cruel, and even less capable of understanding one another than are idiots. Unhappiness does not unite people, but separates them...
Silence accompanies the most significant expressions of happiness and unhappiness.
Silence accompanies the most significant expressions of happiness and unhappiness: those in love understand one another best when silent, while the most heated and impassioned speech at a graveside touches only outsiders, but seems cold and inconsequential to the widow and children of the deceased.
Each of us is full of too many wheels, screws and valves to permit us to judge one another on a first impression or by two or three external signs.
The sea has neither meaning nor pity.
Life is a vexatious trap; when a thinking man reaches maturity and attains to full consciousness he cannot help feeling that he is in a trap from which there is no escape.
There is nothing more awful, insulting, and depressing than banality.
Death can only be profitable: there's no need to eat, drink, pay taxes, offend people, and since a person lies in a grave for hundreds or thousands of years, if you count it up the profit turns out to be enormous.
By poeticizing love, we imagine in those we love virtues that they often do not possess; this then becomes the source of constant mistakes and constant distress.
All of life and human relations have become so incomprehensibly complex that, when you think about it, it becomes terrifying and your heart stands still.
People who live alone always have something on their minds that they would willingly share.
There are no small number of people in this world who, solitary by nature, always try to go back into their shell like a hermit crab or a snail.
If you really think about it, everything is wonderful in this world, everything except for our thoughts and deeds when we forget about the loftier goals of existence, about our human dignity.
Dear, sweet, unforgettable childhood! Why does this irrevocable time, forever departed, seem brighter, more festive and richer than it actually was?
Watching a woman make Russian pancakes, you might think that she was calling on the spirits or extracting from the batter the philosopher's stone.
There is something beautiful, touching and poetic when one person loves more than the other, and the other is indifferent.
Country acquaintances are charming only in the country and only in the summer. In the city in winter they lose half of their appeal.
One can prove or refute anything at all with words. Soon people will perfect language technology to such an extent that they'll be proving with mathematical precision that twice two is seven.
It is uncomfortable to ask condemned people about their sentences just as it is awkward to ask wealthy people why they need so much money, why they use their wealth so poorly, and why they don't just get rid of it when they recognize that it is the cause of their unhappiness.
Only during hard times do people come to understand how difficult it is to be master of their feelings and thoughts.
It’s even pleasant to be sick when you know that there are people who await your recovery as they might await a holiday.
Exquisite nature, daydreams, and music say one thing, real life another.
Love is a scandal of the personal sort.
Probably nature itself gave man the ability to lie so that in difficult and tense moments he could protect his nest, just as do the vixen and wild duck.
Love, friendship, respect, do not unite people as much as a common hatred for something.
Man will only become better when you make him see what he is like.
Death is terrible, but still more terrible is the feeling that you might live for ever and never die.
People love talking of their diseases, although they are the most uninteresting things in their lives.
How intolerable people are sometimes who are happy and successful in everything.
If you wish women to love you, be original; I know a man who used to wear felt boots summer and winter, and women fell in love with him.
Although you may tell lies, people will believe you, if only you speak with authority.
I observed that after marriage people cease to be curious.
It is easier to ask of the poor than of the rich.
They say: "In the long run truth will triumph;" but it is untrue.
There is no Monday which will not give its place to Tuesday.
My mother and father are the only people on the whole planet for whom I will never begrudge a thing. Should I achieve great things, it is the work of their hands; they are splendid people and their absolute love of their children places them above the highest praise. It cloaks all of their shortcomings, shortcomings that may have resulted from a difficult life.
A grimy fly can soil the entire wall and a small, dirty little act can ruin the entire proceedings.
You need to work continually day and night, to read ceaselessly, to study, to exercise your will.... Each hour is precious.
Better to have negative criticism than nothing at all.
When in a serious mood, it seems to me that those people are illogical who feel an aversion toward death. As far as I can see, life consists exclusively of horrors, unpleasantnesses and banalities, now merging, now alternating.
I was so drunk the whole time that I took bottles for girls and girls for bottles.
Writers are as jealous as pigeons.
Happiness does not await us all. One needn't be a prophet to say that there will be more grief and pain than serenity and money. That is why we must hang on to one another.
Hypocrisy is a revolting, psychopathic state.
One must speak about serious things seriously.
Medicine is my lawful wife and literature is my mistress. When I get tired of one I spend the night with the other.
A tree is beautiful, but what's more, it has a right to life; like water, the sun and the stars, it is essential. Life on earth is inconceivable without trees. Forests create climate, climate influences peoples' character, and so on and so forth. There can be neither civilization nor happiness if forests crash down under the axe.
If the climate is harsh and severe, the people are also harsh and severe.
It doesn't matter that your painting is small. Kopecks are also small, but when a lot are put together they make a ruble.
Children are holy and pure. Even those of bandits and crocodiles belong among the angels....
When a person doesn't understand something, he feels internal discord: however he doesn't search for that discord in himself, as he should, but searches outside of himself. Thence a war develops with that which he doesn't understand.
Without a knowledge of languages you feel as if you don't have a passport.
In general, Russia suffers from a frightening poverty in the sphere of facts and a frightening wealth of all types of arguments.
I divide all literary works into two categories: those I like and those I don't like. No other criterion exists for me.
The world is a fine place. The only thing wrong with it is us.
In my opinion it is harmful to place important things in the hands of philanthropy, which in Russia is marked by a chance character. Nor should important matters depend on leftovers, which are never there. I would prefer that the government treasury take care of it.
He who constantly swims in the ocean loves dry land.
Despicable means used to achieve laudable goals render the goals themselves despicable.
The more elevated a culture, the richer its language. The number of words and their combinations depends directly on a sum of conceptions and ideas; without the latter there can be no understandings, no definitions, and, as a result, no reason to enrich a language.
The person who wants nothing, hopes for nothing, and fears nothing can never be an artist.
I abide by a rule concerning reviews: I will never ask, neither in writing nor in person, that a word be put in about my book.... One feels cleaner this way.
When you live on cash, you understand the limits of the world around which you navigate each day. Credit leads into a desert with invisible boundaries.
It's easier to write about Socrates than about a young woman or a cook.
I would love to meet a philosopher like Nietzsche on a train or boat and to talk with him all night. Incidentally, I don't consider his philosophy long-lived. It is not so much persuasive as full of bravura.
It is healthy to engage in sports, they are beautiful and liberal, liberal in the sense that nothing serves quite as well to integrate social classes, etc., than street or public games.
You ask “What is life?” That is the same as asking “What is a carrot?” A carrot is a carrot and we know nothing more.
If I were asked to choose between execution and life in prison I would, of course, choose the latter. It's better to live somehow than not at all.
Capital punishment kills immediately, whereas lifetime imprisonment does so slowly. Which executioner is more humane? The one who kills you in a few minutes, or the one who wrests your life from you in the course of many years?
People should be beautiful in every way—in their faces, in the way they dress, in their thoughts and in their innermost selves.
In countries where there is a mild climate, less effort is expended on the struggle with nature and man is kinder and more gentle.
Russian forests crash down under the axe, billions of trees are dying, the habitations of animals and birds are laid waste, rivers grow shallow and dry up, marvelous landscapes are disappearing forever.... Man is endowed with creativity in order to multiply that which has been given him; he has not created, but destroyed. There are fewer and fewer forests, rivers are drying up, wildlife has become extinct, the climate is ruined, and the earth is becoming ever poorer and uglier.
The world perishes not from bandits and fires, but from hatred, hostility, and all these petty squabbles.
A woman can only become a man's friend in three stages: first, she's an agreeable acquaintance, then a mistress, and only after that a friend.
At the door of every happy person there should be a man with a hammer whose knock would serve as a constant reminder of the existence of unfortunate people.
Money, like vodka, turns a person into an eccentric.
What seems to us serious, significant and important will, in future times, be forgotten or won't seem important at all.
After us they'll fly in hot air balloons, coat styles will change, perhaps they'll discover a sixth sense and cultivate it, but life will remain the same, a hard life full of secrets, but happy.
A thousand years from now man will still be sighing, “Oh! Life is so hard!” and will still, like now, be afraid of death and not want to die.
Dear and most respected bookcase! I welcome your existence, which has for over one hundred years been devoted to the radiant ideals of goodness and justice.
He is no longer a city dweller who has even once in his life caught a ruff or seen how, on clear and cool autumn days, flocks of migrating thrushes drift over a village. Until his death he will be drawn to freedom.

Unconscionable Love, bane and tormentor of mankind, parent of strife, fountain of tears, source of a thousand ills.
In dreams and in love there are no impossibilities.
Love: A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by the removal of the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder. This disease, like caries and many other ailments, is prevalent only among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its ravages. It is sometimes fatal, but more frequently to the physician than to the patient.
Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first.
Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with conflict by peaceful means.
With the destructive power of today's weapons, keeping the peace is not just a goal; it's a sacred obligation.
I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.

Can life be good if you have social anxiety? What things can you enjoy when you have social phobia? Don't you miss too much this way? What do you miss all that for?

Is having a helicopter mother the reason to be idle and not even try to resist all the things that make you mad or even suicidal? And no, I'm not talking about normies who pretend to be hikki just because it's in. And no, this isn't a "get over it" post.

Why do these elderly millionaires and billionaires spend so much time and effort working to make more money? It's not like they have a lot of time left.
I learned this language primarily by memorizing lists of words, and this approach worked tolerably well.

In a Club, though there mayn’t be a soul of your acquaintance in the room, you have always the chance of watching strangers, and speculating on what is going on within those tents and curtains of their souls, their coats and waistcoats. This is a never-failing sport. Indeed I am told there are some Clubs in the town where nobody ever speaks to anybody. They sit in the coffee-room, quite silent, and watching each other.

Caroline Herschel was the first woman to discover a comet.
A tall, slim girl, half-past sixteen, with serious gray eyes and hair which her friends called auburn, had sat down on the broad red sandstone doorstep of a Prince Edward Island farmhouse one ripe afternoon in August.
There are many parts of my youth that I'm not proud of.
Anne had certain rose-tinted ideals of what a teacher might accomplish if she only went the right way about it.
This pleasant vision was shattered by a most unpleasant interruption.
Mr. Harrison was their new righthand neighbor and she had never met him before, although she had seen him once or twice.
He bounced over the fence without waiting to open the gate, and angrily confronted astonished Anne, who had risen to her feet and stood looking at him in some bewilderment.
Before he had been a month in Avonlea he had won the reputation of being an odd person . . . "a crank," Mrs. Rachel Lynde said.
That's what I would do in your place.
I don't want to talk to you now.
As for washing dishes, Mr. Harrison never made any pretence of doing it unless a rainy Sunday came. Then he went to work and washed them all at once in the rainwater hogshead, and left them to drain dry.
When he was asked to subscribe to the Rev. Mr. Allan's salary he said he'd wait and see how many dollars' worth of good he got out of his preaching first.
Mr. Harrison kept a parrot called Ginger.
Nobody in Avonlea had ever kept a parrot before.
Mr. Harrison could not have been considered a handsome man; he was short and fat and bald; and now, with his round face purple with rage and his prominent blue eyes almost sticking out of his head, Anne thought he was really the ugliest person she had ever seen.
I'm not going to put up with this.
"Will you explain what the trouble is?" asked Anne, in her most dignified manner.
The trouble is, miss, that I found that Jersey cow of your aunt's in my oats again, not half an hour ago.
I am very sorry that my cow should have broken into your oats.
"I am very sorry," repeated Anne firmly, "but perhaps if you kept your fences in better repair Dolly might not have broken in. It is your part of the line fence that separates your oatfield from our pasture and I noticed the other day that it was not in very good condition."
"My fence is all right," snapped Mr. Harrison, angrier than ever.
A jail fence couldn't keep a demon of a cow like that out.
Mr. Harrison was very sensitive about his bald head.
His anger choked him up.
I don't know how many aunts he has got. That's the fourth that's died since he was hired here a year ago.
Two years after this event Caroline became his wife.
There was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection.
I think she was impressed.
You did very well. I think he was impressed.
Mary said Dora was really a very good child but that Davy was full of mischief.
Few things in Avonlea ever escaped Mrs. Lynde.
"I think he is a very disagreeable man," said Anne, with a resentful toss of her ruddy head.
I knew there'd be trouble when Robert Bell sold his place to a New Brunswick man, that's what.
I don't know what Avonlea is coming to, with so many strange people rushing into it. It'll soon not be safe to go to sleep in our beds.
Don't play with that.
I asked you not to play with that.
Nobody knows anything about them.
Mrs Lynde looked upon all people who had the misfortune to be born or brought up elsewhere than in Prince Edward Island with a decided can-any-good-thing-come-out-of-Nazareth air. They might be good people, of course; but you were on the safe side in doubting it.
She had a special prejudice against "Yankees." Her husband had been cheated out of ten dollars by an employer for whom he had once worked in Boston and neither angels nor principalities nor powers could have convinced Mrs. Rachel that the whole United States was not responsible for it.
She has been very lonesome since her husband died.
What's this I hear about your going to start up a Village Improvement Society, Anne?
Her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars.
Diana wasn't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant; but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view.

An old house with its windows gone always makes me think of something dead with its eyes picked out.
I think an old, deserted house is such a sad sight.
Marilla says that a large family was raised in that old house long ago, and that it was a real pretty place, with a lovely garden and roses climbing all over it.
I'd like to hear a story.
The house was full of little children and laughter and songs; and now it is empty, and nothing ever wanders through it but the wind. How lonely and sorrowful it must feel!

It is often debated is whether animal experimentation for the development of cosmetics or pharmaceuticals is justified. Many oppose such experimentation on the basis that it causes unnecessary suffering. I argue that it is harmful to animals, unneeded for humans, and morally wrong.
These animals go through horrific experiences during their short lives merely so that the users of the cosmetics can have slightly more attractive features.
The discrepancy between the high moral cost of inflicting pain on these creatures and the insignificant benefit of improving one's appearance is such that the latter cannot be said to outweigh the former.
Though animal experimentation is often argued to be necessary for life-saving medical research, this is often not the case.
Many animal studies unambiguously show certain substances to be poisonous or of medical value in animals, but the results of later studies conducted on humans show that these effects do not occur in people. In other words, the results of these animal studies were useless for producing information of benefit to humans.
Perhaps it may be objected that some animal studies do in fact demonstrate effects similar to those that are later shown to produced in humans. However, the high false positive rate of animal studies in regards to human applicability make them morally dubious.
Many of the types of experiments conducted on animals would never be considered acceptable for human subjects, a fact which demonstrates the existence of an ethical double standard.
Animal experimentation may involve removing organs for no medical reasons, exposing animals to high quantities of toxic or potentially toxic substances, and numerous other procedures that, if performed on humans, would be grounds for prosecution of the experimenter.
It may be objected that humans, as opposed to animals, have intelligence, and therefore have the right not to be experimented upon. However, many humans, such as the mentally disabled, those in vegetative states, or babies, either have no intelligence or limited intelligence, and yet no one is arguing they should be subjected to involuntary, damaging experiments.
In conclusion, animal experimentation is both morally wrong and of limited practical value. It is morally far more costly than the cosmetic products it produces, significantly flawed as a tool for medical research, and its practice in the absence of similar human experimentation is an ethical double standard.
Indoor environments often contain elevated levels of carbon dioxide and lowered levels of oxygen. Studies have shown that such conditions lead to reduced cognitive ability as well as negative health effects; this is detrimental to students' academic performance as well as their overall health.
This improves students' learning in the short term by improving their cognitive function, as well as in the long term by preventing illness that could distract from their studies.
Space research and exploration are scientific enterprises that are crucial for the progress and continued survival of humanity.
There are many reasons why supporting space research is important.
Space has an infinite amount of resources that could be useful for humans.
Satellites provide information that has a significant impact on fields such as meteorology and climate science, as well as agriculture, thus improving crop yields and extending our scientific knowledge of the earth.
Space research is necessary to ensure that mankind is not wiped out by global catastrophes of cosmic origin, such as meteor strikes.
Human exploration to, and settlement of, other planets ensures that if a terrible event does happen on earth, humans will still exist on other planets.
Space research is necessary for the propagation and continuation of the human species.

The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.
The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.
The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.
The human race is a monotonous affair. Most people spend the greatest part of their time working in order to live, and what little freedom remains so fills them with fear that they seek out any and every means to be rid of it.
All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom.
The purpose of life is to contribute in some way to making things better.
It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. ... The life we receive is not short but we make it so; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully.
Time lost is time when we have not lived a full human life, time unenriched by experience, creative endeavor, enjoyment, and suffering. Time lost is time not filled, time left empty.
The cities, the roads, the countryside, the people I meet - they all begin to blur. I tell myself I am searching for something.

Slaves, though held by the laws of men, are free by the laws of God.
That men should pray and fight for their own freedom, and yet keep others in slavery, is certainly acting a very inconsistent, as well as unjust and, perhaps, impious part.
Our people had been so long accustomed to the practice and convenience of having slaves, that very few among them even doubted the propriety and rectitude of it.
It is much to be wished that slavery may be abolished. The honour of the States, as well as justice and humanity, in my opinion, loudly call upon them to emancipate these unhappy people. To contend for our own liberty, and to deny that blessing to others, involves an inconsistency not to be excused.
It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.

With the immigration of Mexicans to the United States, today there are also small communities of Nahuatl speakers in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and New York.
A federal law passed in 2003 gives Mexicans the right to bilingual education.
This percentage represents almost 1,45 million people, of which 198,000 are monolingual, such that Nahuatl is not in danger of dying in the near future.
In 1895, more than 5 percent of the population of Mexico still spoke Nahuatl.

Science doesn't purvey absolute truth. Science is a mechanism. It's a way of trying to improve your knowledge of nature. It's a system for testing your thoughts against the universe and seeing whether they match. And this works, not just for the ordinary aspects of science, but for all of life.
Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.
The impression that science is over has occurred many times in various branches of human knowledge, often because of an explosion of discoveries made by a genius or a small group of men in such a short time that average minds could hardly follow and had the unconscious desire to take breath, to get used to the unexpected things that came to be revealed. Dazzled by these new truths, they could not see beyond.
Science is a way of trying not to fool yourself. The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.
Science doesn't know everything.
It's one of the most boring cities in the world.
It's one of the wealthiest cities in the world.
Well, of course science doesn't know everything. But because science doesn't know everything that doesn't mean science knows nothing.
It's one of the richest cities in the world.
It's one of the cleanest cities in the world.
Science and art belong to the whole world, and before them vanish the barriers of nationality.
Whoever desires progress and prosperity, whoever would advance humanity to a higher plane of civilization, must further the work of the scientist in every way he possibly can.
In science, one can learn the most by studying what seems the least.

The lecture was a total snoozefest.
The lecture was boring.
What is important is not where the words come from, but rather whether they are understood.
I agree with you that today Spanish and Portuguese are as relevant as French, and much more relevant than Italian.
French was the language of diplomacy, and because of this was taught in schools.
The goal, even when a small one, always becomes gooooooooooooooooooal in the mouth of a radio presenter, a full-throated "do" capable of permanently silencing Caruso, and the crowd goes wild, and the stadium forgets it is made of cement and lifts off the ground and into the air.
The enthusiasm that occurs every time the white ball hits the net may seem mysterious or crazy, but it must be kept in mind that the miracle happens infrequently.
The future always begins in the present. Everything you do, or don't do, has some effect on the future.

The youth of all countries want to talk about their hopes and experiences, but the problem of language remains; the Internet has only solved the problem of distance.

Our university medical center is conducting this investigation under the strict control of the Health Ministry.
From the research results published to date, it can be concluded that the new method will soon be usable in practice.

I recommend contributing sentences in your own native language, since people will be able to trust that what you have contributed is likely to be good and natural-sounding.
Even if some sentences by non-native speakers are good, it's really hard to trust that they are good, so members would be helping us much more by limiting their contributions to sentences in their own native languages.
Remember that the purpose of the Tatoeba Project is to create example sentences that can be used for studying languages. It's not really a place to be contributing non-native language sentences for others to correct for you.
It's bad enough to learn something correctly, and then get it wrong. It's a lot worse to spend time learning something that is incorrect, thinking it's correct.
