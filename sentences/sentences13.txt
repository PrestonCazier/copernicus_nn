The general limits of your freedom are merely these: that you do not trespass upon the equal rights of others.

Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.
If civilization is to survive, it must choose the rule of law.
We believe in the principle that governments are properly established only when it is with the consent of the governed.
We must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.
May the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame brightly — until at last the darkness is no more.
May the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace, when men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each, the brotherhood of all.
No people on earth can be held, as a people, to be an enemy, for all humanity shares the common hunger for peace and fellowship and justice.
No nation's security and well-being can be lastingly achieved in isolation but only in effective cooperation with fellow-nations.
A nation's hope of lasting peace cannot be firmly based upon any race in armaments but rather upon just relations and honest understanding with all other nations.
Neither of us got our wish.
God created man to enjoy, not destroy, the fruits of the earth and of their own toil.
I believe the only way to protect my own rights is to protect the rights of others.
I believe as long as we allow conditions to exist that make for second-class citizens, we are making of ourselves less than first-class citizens.
The Statue of Liberty is not tired, and not because it is made of bronze.
Let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation.
Against the dark background of the atomic bomb, the United States does not wish merely to present strength, but also the desire and the hope for peace.
The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us; she demands of us a living example of freedom.
We are a people born of many peoples.
Un-American activity cannot be prevented or routed out by employing un-American methods; to preserve freedom we must use the tools that freedom provides.
I sometimes think we consider too much the good luck of the early bird and not enough the bad luck of the early worm.
Try not to worry about what others think.
We always may be what we might have been.
It's never too late to be what you might have been.
I know what you think of me.
If a government is to be prudent its taxes must produce ample revenues without discouraging enterprise.
You can wipe your shoes with this yellow cloth.
Our revenue laws have operated in many ways to the unfair advantage of the few, and they have done little to prevent an unjust concentration of wealth and economic power.
Taxes should be levied in proportion to ability to pay and in proportion to the benefits received. Income was wisely chosen as the measure of benefits and of ability to pay.
Taxation according to income is the most effective instrument yet devised to obtain just contribution from those best able to bear it and to avoid placing onerous burdens upon the mass of our people.
Wealth in the modern world does not come merely from individual effort; it results from a combination of individual effort and of the manifold uses to which the community puts that effort.
In spite of the great importance in our national life of the efforts and ingenuity of unusual individuals, the people in the mass have inevitably helped to make large fortunes possible.
An American Government cannot permit Americans to starve.
It was natural and perhaps human that the privileged princes of these new economic dynasties, thirsting for power, reached out for control over government itself. They created a new despotism and wrapped it in the robes of legal sanction. In its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the people, their labor, and their property.
For too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other people's property, other people's money, other people's labor — other people's lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness.
There is a mysterious cycle in human events. To some generations much is given. Of other generations much is expected.
I wish I could keep war from all Nations; but that is beyond my power. I can at least make certain that no act of the United States helps to produce or to promote war.
Many causes produce war. There are ancient hatreds, turbulent frontiers, the "legacy of old forgotten, far-off things, and battles long ago." There are new-born fanaticisms. Convictions on the part of certain peoples that they have become the unique depositories of ultimate truth and right.
The true conservative seeks to protect the system of private property and free enterprise by correcting such injustices and inequalities as arise from it.
The most serious threat to our institutions comes from those who refuse to face the need for change.
Wise and prudent men — intelligent conservatives — have long known that in a changing world worthy institutions can be conserved only by adjusting them to the changing time.
We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.
They are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.
It is an old strategy of tyrants to delude their victims into fighting their battles for them.
No man can occupy the office of President without realizing that he is President of all the people.
The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.
All but the hopelessly reactionary will agree that to conserve our primary resources of man power, government must have some control over maximum hours, minimum wages, the evil of child labor and the exploitation of unorganized labor.
Those who cherish their freedom and recognize and respect the equal right of their neighbors to be free and live in peace must work together for the triumph of law and moral principles in order that peace, justice, and confidence may prevail in the world.
International anarchy destroys every foundation for peace. It jeopardizes either the immediate or the future security of every nation, large or small.
I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American people.
No business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country.
A nation does not have to be cruel to be tough.
The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself.
The liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living.
Among us today a concentration of private power without equal in history is growing.
No democracy can long survive which does not accept as fundamental to its very existence the recognition of the rights of its minorities.
Repetition does not transform a lie into a truth.
We must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the American Eagle in order to feather their own nests.
As a nation, we may take pride in the fact that we are soft-hearted; but we cannot afford to be soft-headed.
Enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom.
Prophets of the downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught.

Robin Hood and his band of merry men live in Sherwood Forest.
The princess disguised herself as a page.
Robin Hood loves Marian.
I love you more than life itself.
In merry England in the time of old, when good King Henry the Second ruled the land, there lived within the green glades of Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham Town, a famous outlaw whose name was Robin Hood.
And now I will tell how it came about that Robin Hood fell afoul of the law.
When Robin was a youth of eighteen, the Sheriff of Nottingham proclaimed a shooting match and offered a prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best shaft in Nottinghamshire.
St Paul's Cathedral was destroyed in the Great Fire of London.
St Paul's Cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights in London.
St Paul's Cathedral was designed by Christopher Wren.
Robin whistled as he trudged along, thinking of Maid Marian and her bright eyes, for at such times a youth's thoughts are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best.
The arrow whistled within three inches of his head.
The Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would bring this knave Robin Hood to justice.
Robin Hood lay hidden in Sherwood Forest for one year, and in that time there gathered around him many others like himself, cast out from other folk for this cause and for that.

Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net force.
When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.
Law I: Every body persists in its state of being at rest or of moving uniformly straight forward, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by force impressed.
Law II: The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed.
Law III: To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts.
This is surely the most satisfying victory I have had in some while.
Kids grow up so fast.
I don't like to argue about politics.
If you had told me that in the first place, I wouldn't have done it.
Men will sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.

Mary says that she can see ghosts.
A popular pastime while orbiting Earth is simply looking out the window.
The space station is designed to be a permanent orbiting research facility. Its major purpose is to perform world-class science and research that only a microgravity environment can provide.
The station crew spends their day working on science experiments.
A spacesuit is much more than a set of clothes astronauts wear on spacewalks. A fully equipped spacesuit is really a one-person spacecraft.
The formal name for the spacesuit used on the International Space Station is the Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or EMU.
The spacesuit protects the astronaut from the dangers of being outside in space.
In Earth orbit, conditions can be as cold as minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit. In the sunlight, they can be as hot as 250 degrees. A spacesuit protects astronauts from those extreme temperatures.
Spacesuits supply astronauts with oxygen to breathe while they are in the vacuum of space.
Spacesuits protect astronauts from being injured from impacts of small bits of space dust.
Space dust may not sound very dangerous, but when even a tiny object is moving many times faster than a bullet, it can cause injury.
Spacesuits also protect astronauts from radiation in space.
The spacesuits have visors to protect astronauts' eyes from the bright sunlight.
NASA's first spacesuits were developed for the Mercury program.
NASA's first spacewalks took place during the Gemini program.
Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov performed the first spacewalk on March 18, 1965.
The first spacewalk was 10 minutes long.
Astronaut Ed White performed the first American spacewalk during the Gemini 4 mission on June 3, 1965.
The world record for the most spacewalks is held by Russian astronaut Anatoly Solovyev with a total of 16 EVAs and more than 82 hours outside in space.
Experiments can be attached to the outside of a spacecraft to see how the space environment affects different things.
Spacesuits protect spacewalkers from the harsh environment of space.
Spacesuits protect astronauts from extreme hot and cold temperatures, harmful space dust and radiation. They also give astronauts oxygen to breathe and water to drink during spacewalks.
Tom's in heaven now.
Astronauts prepare for spacewalks by practicing their tasks underwater in a giant pool called NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.
The microgravity environment of space makes the ISS a unique laboratory for the testing of spacecraft systems that will be required for future exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.
The ISS travels in orbit around the Earth at an average speed of 27,743.8 km/h, completing 15.7 orbits per day.
The ISS is operated jointly among five participating space agencies : the United States’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) , and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).
An international crew, typically consisting of six members, resides on the ISS for approximately six months at a time.
The ISS requires a constant supply of oxygen to keep the astronauts safe and in top condition.
On Earth, new oxygen is produced from plants through the process of photosynthesis.
The primary sources of oxygen on the ISS are the Russian-built Elektron Oxygen Generator unit and NASA’s Oxygen Generator System (OGS).
Hubble was not the first telescope launched into space, nor is it the largest telescope at astronomers’ disposal.
Hubble’s suite of instruments also allows the observatory to record wavelengths of light not just in the visible range but in ultraviolet and near-infrared wavelengths (which are not visible to our eyes).
Astronauts aboard the ISS do not feel the effects of gravity as we do on Earth.
As the ISS orbits the Earth, both the vehicle and crew members are in a constant state of free-fall causing astronauts to experience a feeling of weightlessness.
Observing with the Hubble telescope, astronomers have refined their calculation for the universe’s expansion rate and discovered the existence of a force called dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand faster and faster as time goes on.
Astronauts are scheduled to exercise approximately two hours per day to maintain their health while on the ISS.
The Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) allows the crew to engage in resistive exercise onboard the ISS by simulating the use of free weights.
After a long day at work, nothing is better than a good night's sleep.
Space has no "up" or "down."
Astronauts are weightless and can sleep in any orientation. However, they have to attach themselves so they don't float around and bump into something.
Space station crews usually sleep in sleeping bags located in small crew cabins.
Spacewalks usually last between five and eight hours, depending on the job.
Sometimes a large robotic arm is used to move astronauts on spacewalks. Astronauts are attached to the robotic arm using a foot restraint.
The airlock has two doors.
When on a spacewalk, astronauts use safety tethers to attach themselves to their spacecraft.
Astronauts use tethers to keep tools from floating away. They tether their tools to their spacesuits.
SAFER is worn like a backpack. It uses small jet thrusters to let an astronaut move around in space.
As Saturn orbits the Sun, though, our view of its rings changes.
Earth rotates eastward on its axis, one complete turn each day.
At the equator, Earth's surface is rotating at 1675 kilometers per hour!
If we launch the rocket toward the east, it will get a big boost from Earth's rotational motion.
The layer of our atmosphere closest to the surface of Earth is called the troposphere. “Tropos” means change. This layer gets its name from the weather that is constantly changing and mixing up the gases in this part of our atmosphere.
The troposphere is between 8 and 14 kilometers thick depending on where you are on Earth. It’s thinnest at the North and South Pole.
The troposphere contains three-quarters of the mass of the entire atmosphere.
The ozone layer helps protect us from ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
Have you ever seen a meteor shower, where meteors burn up and streak across the sky? Those meteors are burning up in the mesosphere.
The exosphere is the outermost layer of our atmosphere.
Infrared radiation, visible light, and ultraviolet light are all types of waves in the electromagnetic spectrum.
Infrared waves have less energy than visible light waves.
Ultraviolet waves have more energy than visible light does. It’s this energy that can hurt us.
Tom and Mary were in a very close relationship; one of them could not be far away from the other.
Ultraviolet light comes from the sun, but it can also bounce off of other surfaces like water, snow, and concrete.
Ultraviolet light can also go through clouds, so you can get sunburns on an overcast day.
Sunblock contains chemicals that can reflect or absorb the ultraviolet light.
Playing the piano is very simple: one only needs to press the right key at the right time.
Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the sun’s constant flow of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings. This place is called the heliopause. It marks the end of a region created by our sun that is called the heliosphere.
Tom doesn't wear pajamas. He sleeps naked.
The sun creates the heliosphere by sending a constant flow of particles and a magnetic field out into space at over 670,000 miles per hour. This stream is called the solar wind.
Never look directly at the Sun, even for a second! It will damage your eyesight forever!
A greenhouse stays warmer than the air outside. Instead of cooling off at night, it traps some of the heat inside to keep the plants warm.
What if Earth's atmosphere started to behave like a too-hot greenhouse? We cannot open Earth's windows or doors to cool it off.
When white light shines through a prism, the light is separated into all its colors.
Volcanoes can be active, dormant, or extinct.
Active volcanoes are volcanoes that have had recent eruptions or are expected to have eruptions in the near future.
Dormant volcanoes no longer produce eruptions, but might again sometime in the future.
Extinct volcanoes will likely never erupt again.
The Sakurajima Volcano in Japan is one of the most active volcanoes in the world.
Magma can rise when pieces of Earth's crust called tectonic plates slowly move away from each other. The magma rises up to fill in the space.
Humans have looked to the skies to find their way since ancient times.
Ancient sailors used the constellations in the night sky to figure out where they were and where they were going.
One of Einstein's ideas is that objects cause the space around them to curve. He thought that large objects, like the Sun, curve the space around them more than small objects do. Objects moving through space follow the curvature.
If mass curves space, then very large masses moving quickly through space would create ripples in space. These are called gravitational waves.
Gravitational waves are very hard to detect.
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a space mission that will be able to detect gravitational waves.
LISA will place three spacecraft in orbit around the Sun, tagging along behind Earth. The three spacecraft will be 5 million kilometers apart flying in a triangle formation. When a gravitational wave passes by, these ripples in space gently push the spacecraft around by the tiniest amount imaginable. But the super-super-super sensitive laser beams that connect the three spacecraft will allow this tiny movement to be measured.
LISA will look for gravitational waves from stars and black holes.
Nothing is darker than a black hole.
A black hole is an area of such immense gravity that nothing—not even light—can escape from it.
A spectrometer uses light to identify the chemical composition of matter.
The moon is not always the same distance away from Earth.
When the moon is the farthest away, it’s 252,088 miles away. That’s almost 32 Earths. When it's closest, the moon is 225,623 miles away. That’s between 28 and 29 Earths.
You're going to get us both killed.
From my room in Brooklyn I can see all the way to Manhattan.
The planet is warming up fast—faster than at any time scientists know about from their studies of Earth's entire history.
Tom raises racing pigeons.
All living things on Earth contain carbon. Even you contain carbon.
All living things on Earth contain carbon.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. That means it traps heat from Earth's surface and holds the heat in the atmosphere.
Scientists have learned that, throughout Earth's history, temperature and CO2 levels in the air are closely tied.
CO₂ levels never rose over 280 parts per million until 1950.
In Antarctica, scientists have drilled down two miles below the surface and brought up samples of the ice. These samples are called ice cores.
I want to go downtown.
The ice contains bubbles of the air from each year. Scientists analyze the bubbles in each layer to see how much CO2 they contain.
Glaciers are frozen rivers. They flow like rivers, only much slower.
In places such as Glacier National Park, the glaciers are melting and disappearing. The air is getting warmer, and less snow is falling during winter to renew the melted parts of the glaciers.
As more sea ice and glaciers melt, the global sea level rises.
Melting ice is not the only cause of rising sea level. As the ocean gets warmer, the water expands.
If Greenland's ice sheet were to melt completely, sea level all over the world would rise by 5 to 7 meters.
Life is a web, with every strand connected to every other strand. One species of plant or animal changes, and a whole chain of events can follow involving many other species.
Life is a web, with every strand connected to every other strand.
Caribou hate mosquitoes.
In the past few years, warmer temperatures in summer have allowed mosquito populations to explode. So the caribou spend a lot more energy swatting away the mosquitoes. All this swatting leaves the caribou less energy to find food and prepare for the next long winter.
Animals that hibernate in the winter also suffer from warming temperatures. Marmots, chipmunks, and bears are waking up as much as a month early. Some are not hibernating at all.
With warmer, drier conditions, the trees are more likely to become infected with insects.
When the forest is gone, birds and small mammals that lived there have to find new homes—if they can.
The Earth is thicker around the equator.
The Earth is an oblate spheroid.
Your carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide released into the air because of your own energy needs.
Walk or ride your bike instead of taking a car everywhere.
Bring your own mug.
Carry your drinking water in a reusable bottle. Plastic water bottles are an environmental disaster!
This smokestack is releasing greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere.
The South Pole is a lot colder than the North Pole.
The Arctic ice is shrinking because the ocean under the ice is warming.
About 250 million years ago, all the continents we see today were one big supercontinent called Pangaea.
About 800 million years ago, all the continents were pushed together. We call this supercontinent Rodinia.
The Ice Age was a time when woolly mammoths roamed the Earth.
There may have been as many as four different Ice Ages in the past.
The Atacama Desert in northern Chile is the driest place on Earth.
The differences in gravity across Earth are called gravity anomalies.
A mission called GRACE has a satellite that orbits Earth and maps the gravity across the surface.
During the last Ice Age, so much water was trapped in icy glaciers that the sea level dropped by as much as 120 meters.
There are parts of land today that used to be far beneath the ocean waters.
Our sun will run out of energy in about five billion years.
Our sun will run out of energy in about five billion years. If anyone is around when it happens, they’ll have to leave Earth and find a new planet.
You should always turn off the light when you leave a room. This can save a lot of energy.
The ocean covers 70% of Earth's surface.
In some places, the ocean is deeper than the tallest mountains are high!
The ocean contains about 97% of all the water on Earth.
The top few meters of the ocean store as much heat as Earth's entire atmosphere.
If the ocean gets too warm, then the plants and animals that live in it must adapt—or die.
Algae and plankton are at the bottom of the food chain.
Tiny animals such as krill eat plankton.
Fish and even whales and seals feed on the krill.
In some parts of the ocean, krill populations have dropped by over 80 percent.
Krill like to breed in really cold water near sea ice.
The ocean is becoming more acidic.
The ocean is great at sucking up CO₂ from the air. It absorbs about one-quarter of the CO₂ that we humans create when we burn fossil fuels.
Liquids are either acid or alkaline.
Lemon juice is an example of an acidic liquid.
Toothpaste is alkaline.
The ocean is slightly alkaline.
When the ocean absorbs a lot of CO₂, the water becomes more acidic.
Saltier water is heavier than less salty water.
Glaciers, land ice and icebergs are made of fresh water.
In the United States, coal makes 39% of our electricity.
In West Virginia, over 90% of the electricity is generated from coal. But in California, only 1% of electricity is generated from this fossil fuel.
Ancient Greeks built water wheels to grind grain thousands of years ago.
Vanguard 1 was the first spacecraft to use solar cells. It's the oldest artificial satellite still in orbit around Earth.
Lots of researchers are working to make better batteries that last longer and hold more energy.
Temperatures in the Arctic are rising 2 to 3 times faster than temperatures farther south.
Light colors reflect more sunlight than dark colors. That's why people are more comfortable in light-colored clothing in the summer.
Sea ice reflects more sunlight than does the darker ocean.
Scientists are keeping a close watch on conditions in the Arctic.
When the water vapor in the atmosphere cools, it condenses back into little droplets of liquid water, forming clouds.
Bright white cloud-tops reflect a lot of sunlight back into space. But clouds also blanket Earth, keeping some of its heat from escaping.
Pluto is closer to the sun than Neptune for about 8% of its orbit.
Pluto is a dwarf planet that lies in the Kuiper Belt.
Pluto is only about half the width of the United States.

Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, but it’s not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
Lake Manicouagan, a ring-shaped lake in Quebec, Canada, is all that remains of a crater from a massive impact over 200 million years ago.
The dusty footsteps of astronauts who once walked on the Moon are still there today—and they aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

Tom was amazed to see Mary's elaborate and upswept coiffure for her high school reunion. He wondered if, despite her very real accomplishments, she might still be at heart somewhat insecure, vain and egotistical.
Mary told Tom to behave himself at the party this time. Last time they'd gone out he had thrown decorum to the winds, and she didn't want to be embarrassed by him again.
Tom took two profiteroles from the dessert tray and said: "Look, I can be a squirrel." He stuffed one of the pastries in each cheek to distort his face. Mary tried to ignore him for the rest of the evening.
Mary is sometimes given to hyperbole. When Tom arrived much later than he'd promised, Mary said: "I've gone through four seasons waiting for you."
Tom and Mary launched their boat from the slipway at the tip of the peninsula.
Tom should have known that bringing contraband into the country would surely involve him with the wrong sort of people.
Tom laughed to hear an American right-wing activist tell a journalist that she wouldn't support three politicians in the election. She said that one was satanic and the second a sellout, while she really didn't like the third fellow.
After the death of his spouse, Tom more or less let the business slide.
Tom had been down on his luck for some weeks.
Tom will up sticks at his aunt's house; he thinks he may be a burden to her.
After the bailiff repossessed Tom's house, he was forced to doss down at a homeless shelter.
February seventh is Northern Territories Day.
If an email starts out, "Hi, I'm Sunshine," just delete the message without reading further.
As a lark, Tom bought Mary a plastic-grass hula skirt and a coconut-shell bra, momentarily forgetting that her opportunities to wear this colourful get-up would be somewhat limited.
For fourteen years Tom had owned a purebred dog, and he remembered that the breeder had furnished him a pedigree chart showing every dam and sire going back four generations.
After Tom had filled in his genealogical pedigree chart with the information he already knew, the remaining gaps revealed where he'd need to do some research to complete all his ancestral lines.
I could go for a beer right about now.
By now resigned to the knowledge that neither Tom nor Mary were likely prospects for religious conversion, the missionaries they'd invited in encouraged Tom to visit a local family history centre or to make use of the Internet to research his ancestors.
The two young men were quite engaging and friendly; they had been sent out by their church as missionaries.
Although Mary is a lapsed Catholic, and Tom no longer believes in God, they invited the missionaries in and gave them each a glass of water.
Mary and Tom thought it would be a shame if much of the oral history they had so patiently gathered were to be lost because of not being written down. Because neither of them knew shorthand, they bought an audio recorder so that they could better enjoy their visits with Tom's three living grandparents without having to focus on taking careful written notes.
Being the oldest of her siblings, Joanna inherited a family Bible, which contained the names of her father, grandfather and great-grandmother along with their respective dates and places of birth, baptism, marriage and death and the birthdays of all their descendants.
On his recent visit with his grandparents in Boston, Tom listened with growing empathy as they related tales of their hardscrabble childhoods and their coming of age during the Great Depression. His grandfather also spoke of enlisting in the army during World War II.

The body of the plane is called the fuselage. It is generally a long tube shape.
The body of a plane is called the fuselage.
Most landing gear can be folded into the fuselage during the flight and opened for landing.
All planes have wings.
All birds have wings.
The tail at the rear of the plane provides stability.
The rudder at the back of the plane moves left and right to control the left or right movement of the plane.
The elevators are found at the rear of the plane. They can be raised or lowered to change the direction of the plane's nose.
The flaps and ailerons are connected to the backside of the wings.
The flaps slide back and down to increase the surface of the wing area. They also tilt down to increase the curve of the wing.
The slats move out from the front of the wings to make the wing space larger. This helps to increase the lifting force of the wing at slower speeds like takeoff and landing.
The ailerons are hinged on the wings and move downward to push the air down and make the wing tilt up. This moves the plane to the side and helps it turn during flight.
After landing, the spoilers are used like air brakes to reduce any remaining lift and slow down the airplane.
A force is a vector quantity so a force has both a magnitude and a direction.
Weight is a force that is always directed toward the center of the earth.
In flight, the airplane rotates about the center of gravity.
During a flight, an airplane's weight constantly changes as the aircraft consumes fuel.
To overcome the weight force, airplanes generate an opposing force called lift.
Lift is generated by the motion of the airplane through the air and is an aerodynamic force.
Lift is directed perpendicular to the flight direction.
The magnitude of the lift depends on several factors including the shape, size, and velocity of the aircraft.
Most of the lift is generated by the wings.
Aerodynamic surfaces are used to control the aircraft in roll, pitch, and yaw.
Why do you hang out with those losers?
"Why do you hang out with those losers?" "They're not losers. They're my friends."
As the airplane moves through the air, the air resists the motion of the aircraft and the resistance force is called drag.
Like lift, there are many factors that affect the magnitude of the drag force including the shape of the aircraft, the "stickiness" of the air, and the velocity of the aircraft.
To overcome drag, airplanes use a propulsion system to generate a force called thrust.
The direction of the thrust force depends on how the engines are attached to the aircraft.
In the figure shown above, two turbine engines are located under the wings, parallel to the body, with thrust acting along the body centerline.
On some aircraft, such as the Harrier, the thrust direction can be varied to help the airplane take off in a very short distance.
There are some aircraft, called gliders, that have no engines at all, but fly just fine.
During reentry and landing, the Space Shuttle is a glider.
Math and science were invented by humans to describe and understand the world around us.
Mathematicians and scientists call a quantity which depends on direction a vector quantity. A quantity which does not depend on direction is called a scalar quantity.
A vector quantity has two characteristics, a magnitude and a direction.
When comparing two vector quantities of the same type, you have to compare both the magnitude and the direction.
This example is a little more complex.
I told you to watch your mouth!
Theories on the generation of lift have become a source of great controversy and a topic for heated arguments.
Air is a physical substance which has weight.
There are many explanations for the generation of lift found in encyclopedias, in basic physics textbooks, and on Web sites. Unfortunately, many of the explanations are misleading and incorrect.
Lift occurs when a moving flow of gas is turned by a solid object. The flow is turned in one direction, and the lift is generated in the opposite direction, according to Newton's Third Law of action and reaction.
The magnitude of the force acting over a small section of an object immersed in a fluid equals the pressure p times the area A of the section.
Pressure acts perpendicular to the solid surface of an object.
To obtain the net mechanical force over the entire object, we must sum the contributions from all the small sections. Mathematically, the summation is indicated by the Greek letter sigma (Σ).
According to Newton's second law of motion, a force is produced when a mass is accelerated.
A force causes a change in velocity; and, likewise, a change in velocity generates a force. The equation works both ways.
Parts facing the oncoming flow are said to be windward, and parts facing away from the flow are said to be leeward.
Airplanes fly by moving through almost still air, yet we design and test them using wind tunnels, where the airplane model is fixed and the air is made to move past the model.
The conservation of momentum is a fundamental concept of physics along with the conservation of energy and the conservation of mass.
Momentum is defined to be the mass of an object multiplied by the velocity of the object.
Most people are introduced to vectors in high school or college.
Thermodynamics is a branch of physics which deals with the energy and work of a system.
Flight faster than sound was thought to be impossible.
Do you copy? Over.
In a rocket engine, fuel and a source of oxygen, called an oxidizer, are mixed and exploded in a combustion chamber. The combustion produces hot exhaust which is passed through a nozzle to accelerate the flow and produce thrust.
In outer space there is no atmosphere so turbines and propellers cannot work there. This explains why a rocket works in space but a turbine engine or a propeller does not work.
There are two main categories of rocket engines; liquid rockets and solid rockets.
In a liquid rocket, the propellants, the fuel and the oxidizer, are stored separately as liquids and are pumped into the combustion chamber of the nozzle where burning occurs.
In a solid rocket, the propellants are mixed together and packed into a solid cylinder. Under normal temperature conditions, the propellants do not burn; but they will burn when exposed to a source of heat provided by an igniter. Once the burning starts, it proceeds until all the propellant is exhausted.
You can stop the thrust of a liquid rocket by turning off the flow of propellants.
Liquid rockets tend to be heavier and more complex because of the pumps and storage tanks.
The X-15 was powered by a liquid rocket engine and carried a single pilot to a height of more than 60 miles above the earth.
For the forty years following the first flight of the Wright brothers, airplanes used internal combustion engines to turn propellers to generate thrust.
The propeller acts like a rotating wing creating a lift force by moving through the air.
For a propeller-powered aircraft, the gas that is accelerated, or the working fluid, is the surrounding air that passes through the propeller.
Propellers can have from 2 to 6 blades.
After World War II, as jet engines gained popularity, aerodynamicists used jet engines to turn the propellers on some aircraft. This propulsion system is called a turboprop.
A C-130 transport plane is a turboprop aircraft. Its main thrust comes from the propellers, but the propellers are turned by turbine engines.
Propeller-powered aircraft are very efficient for low speed flight.
Propellers are not used on high speed aircraft.
Most modern passenger and military aircraft are powered by gas turbine engines, which are also called jet engines.
I still haven't found a job.
In order for fighter planes to fly faster than sound, they have to overcome a sharp rise in drag near the speed of sound.
Afterburners are only used on supersonic aircraft like fighter planes and the Concorde supersonic airliner.
Most modern airliners use turbofan engines because of their high thrust and good fuel efficiency.
A turbofan engine is the most modern variation of the basic gas turbine engine.
In 1640, Evagelista Torricelli discovered that air has weight. When experimenting with measuring mercury, he discovered that air put pressure on the mercury.
Hot air expands and spreads out and it becomes lighter than cool air. When a balloon is full of hot air it rises up because the hot air expands inside the balloon.
The pilot controls the engine power using the throttle.
The pilot controls the roll of the plane by raising one aileron or the other with a control wheel.
The rudder works to control the yaw of the plane.
The pilot moves rudder left and right, with left and right pedals.
The elevators which are on the tail section are used to control the pitch of the plane.
In 1874, Felix du Temple, built a monoplane that flew just a short hop down a hill with the help of a coal fired steam engine.
The first gasoline engine was invented in the late 1800's.
In 1903, the Wright Brothers flew, The Flyer, with a 12 horse power gas powered engine.
Frank Whittle, a British pilot, designed and patented the first turbo jet engine in 1930.
At the same time that Whittle was working in England, Hans von Ohain was working on a similar design in Germany. The first airplane to successfully use a gas turbine engine was the German Heinkel He 178, in August, 1939. It was the world's first turbojet powered flight.
The only flavor of ice cream that Tom eats is vanilla.
Icarus tried to fly too high and flew too near to the sun. The wings of wax melted and Icarus fell to his death in the ocean.
Daedalus was an engineer who was imprisoned by King Minos. With his son, Icarus, he made wings of wax and feathers.
For many centuries, humans have tried to fly just like the birds. Wings made of feathers or light weight wood have been attached to arms to test their ability to fly. The results were often disastrous as the muscles of the human arms are not like a birds and cannot move with the strength of a bird.
Leonardo da Vinci's Ornithopter flying machine was never actually created.
The brothers Joseph Michel and Jacques Etienne Montgolfier were inventors of the first hot air balloon.
German engineer Otto Lilienthal studied aerodynamics and worked to design a glider that would fly. He was the first person to design a glider that could fly a person and was able to fly long distances.
The Wright Brothers first performed a literature search to find out the state of aeronautical knowledge at their time. They wrote to the Smithsonian and obtained technical papers regarding aerodynamics. They read about the works of Cayley, and Langley, and the hang-gliding flights of Otto Lilienthal.
The Wright Brothers spent a great deal of time observing birds in flight. They noticed that birds soared into the wind and that the air flowing over the curved surface of their wings created lift.
Birds change the shape of their wings to turn and maneuver.

I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once more able to defend our island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny.
The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength.
Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail.
We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.

What would happen if you were high above Earth’s surface or in space without a protective pressure suit or spacesuit? Would you explode? Would your blood boil? Could you survive?
The lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at Earth’s surface and reaches up to 7 kilometers at the poles and to about 17–18 kilometers at the equator.
The higher in the atmosphere you travel, the less air there is.
Since most of the air is located closest to Earth’s surface, the troposphere is the densest layer of the atmosphere.
Up to 75 percent of the mass of the atmosphere is in the troposphere.
At sea level, the weight of Earth’s atmosphere exerts a force of 14.7 pounds on every square inch of our bodies.
Within the thermosphere, temperatures rise continually to well beyond 1,000 degrees C.
Temperatures in the mesosphere drop with increasing altitude to about -100 degrees C.
Usain Bolt is still the fastest man in the world.
The mesosphere is cold enough to freeze water vapor into ice clouds. You can see these clouds if sunlight hits them after sunset. They are called noctilucent clouds.
The mesosphere is also the layer in which a lot of meteors burn up while entering Earth’s atmosphere.
The exosphere is the highest layer of the atmosphere. It extends from the top of the thermosphere up to 10,000 kilometers.
Air atoms and molecules are constantly escaping to space from the exosphere.
As elevation increases, air pressure decrease.
Lower air pressure makes it more difficult for humans to breathe and get enough oxygen.
I think someone stole my password.
Brain cells are particularly sensitive to a loss of oxygen.
I need people who I can trust.
Decompression sickness, or "the bends," is a buildup of nitrogen bubbles in the bloodstream and other areas of the body.
Spacewalkers must wear pressurized spacesuits in order to work in space. These suits have pressures significantly lower than the ambient cabin pressure of a spacecraft.
If you live at a higher altitude, water boils at a lower temperature.
In Denver, Colorado, where the altitude is around 5,200 feet (just about 1 mile above sea level), reduced air pressure causes water to boil 4 to 5 degrees C below the standard 100 degrees C.
In the near vacuum of space, there is no air or ambient temperature, since there is no air.
The temperature of an object in space, such as the Space Station, an astronaut working out in space, or even larger objects like the Moon or Earth, changes when the Sun shines on them.
During an EVA, the outer layer of an astronaut's spacesuit may be 120 degrees C for the side facing the Sun, and the part of that same suit facing away from the Sun could have an external temperature of -100 C.
The central nervous system, which includes the brain and the eyes, is particularly sensitive to oxygen deficiency.
Very low oxygen levels result in impaired judgment and ability to concentrate, lack of night vision acuity, shortness of breath, nausea, and fatigue.
In space, your body would swell without a pressure suit because liquid in your soft tissues and, to a lesser extent, water in your circulatory system would begin to vaporize. Contrary to some existing myths, you would not explode—your skin is too strong for that to happen.
Space is actually a good insulator because it is difficult to transfer heat to nothing.
He will certainly be late.

Since the early 1990s, mainly due to the decreasing seasonal sea ice in the Bellinghausen Sea, the population of the native Adélie penguin has catastrophically declined.
In the western Antarctic Peninsula region of the Bellinghausen Sea, temperatures are rapidly warming, and changes in the marine ecosystem are underway.
Algae feed large swarms of Antarctic krill, which are the main food for large predators, including the region’s Adélie penguins.
In the Northern Hemisphere, Arctic air temperatures are warming twice as fast as lower latitudes.
Walruses mate along ice edges in the drifting pack ice during winter and give birth on sea ice in spring.
Walruses use sea ice to rest, if it is close to where they hunt for food.
Unfortunately, that's the reality.
The larger fish from the south will compete with the smaller Arctic species for food, and even prey on them directly.
As new competitors and predators arrive, even the most abundant Arctic species in the northern Barents Sea, the local Polar cod, could become extinct.
In the northeast Pacific, a widespread bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia algae stretched off the North American coast from southern California to British Columbia during spring and summer 2015.
Pseudo-nitzschia produces a neurotoxin called domoic acid, which can build up in shellfish, other invertebrates, and fish. This can lead to illness and death in a variety of birds and mammals that consume them.
Everything that we think of as “modern human civilization”—permanent agriculture, continuously occupied cities, free WiFi—has emerged since the last ice age ended roughly 11,000 years ago.
Throughout its 4.54-billion-year history, Earth has experienced multiple periods of temperatures hotter than today’s. But as far as the “recent” past is concerned, a study published in March 2013 concluded that global average temperature is now higher than it has been for most of the last 11,300 years.
The scientists assembled dozens of temperature records from multiple studies, including data from sediment cores drilled in lake bottoms and sea floors, and from ice cores.
Assembling data from 73 records that overlap in time, the scientists pieced together global average temperatures since the end of the last ice age.
Over the past century, global average temperatures have risen from near the coldest to the warmest levels in the past 11,300 years.
The recent increase in global average temperature is so abrupt compared to the rest of the time period that when the scientists make a graph of the data, the end of the line is nearly vertical.
Most of what we consider modern civilization fits within the last 11,000 years—a period of remarkable climatic stability in which people have been able to continuously inhabit in the same regions for millennia.
For most of the past 10,000 years, global average temperature has remained relatively stable and low compared to earlier hothouse conditions in our planet's history.
Carrie Morrill of the National Climatic Data Center explains, "You'd have to go back to the last interglacial about 125,000 years ago to find temperatures significantly higher than temperatures of today."
The Great Barrier Reef, located off the northeast tip of Australia, is one of the natural wonders of the world.
Coral bleaching does not immediately kill corals. They have the potential to recover if temperatures drop back below stressful levels and remain there for a long period of time—with no new shocks.
As the Colorado River spills through seven southwestern states and parts of Northern Mexico, more than 35 million people depend on its water.
I presume you're Tom Jackson.
Winding through the high desert, across Colorado, Utah, Arizona and on down the California border, the Colorado river irrigates nearly 4.5 million acres of crops worth billions of dollars annually, nourishes plant and animal life in 11 national parks, and generates more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity.
Southwestern cities like Phoenix and Tucson have some of the fastest-growing populations in the country.
Founded in 1902, the Bureau of Reclamation planned and built the water projects that made it possible for people to settle the desert Southwest.
Coral bleaching occurs when corals become heat-stressed enough to expel their primary source of food, the microalgae that live inside their cells. This leaves the coral looking as white as if they had been soaking in bleach.
Sadly, almost all climate models show that meaningful recovery of corals along the Great Barrier Reef may be very difficult, if it is even possible at all.
Cacao can only grow within about 20° north and south of the equator.
Cacao trees only prosper under specific conditions, including fairly uniform temperatures, high humidity, abundant rain, nitrogen-rich soil, and protection from wind.
Cacao trees thrive in rainforests.
The world's leading cacao producers are Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Indonesia.
Mary, we're your friends. You can tell us.
Cotton ranks among the world's most important crops.
Cotton may have been used in India as long ago as 3500 BC, and in Peru as long ago as 3000 BC.
Most of the world's cotton is grown in China, India, the United States, and Pakistan.
The United States is the world's leading cotton exporter.

I think we should have turned left at that last intersection instead of right.

How does Tom feel about it?
That's my mistake.
I sure hope Tom likes this song.
I wanted to watch that movie with you.
Here are today's ledgers.
A three-person team is undertaking a 40,000-kilometre motorcycle journey from the Arctic Circle in Alaska to the southern tip of South America.
Of course, the three motorcyclists, having swapped their gasoline engines for electric motors, have to have large battery packs, which will be mounted transversely behind the riders.
On their journey, the pioneering team of electric motorcycle riders hope to meet the wealthy owner of a major battery manufacturing plant in Las Vegas.
Besides his battery manufacturing company, the business magnate also has ventures to build reusable rocket stages for commercial space flight, fully electric cars and cheaper, more efficient solar panels.
A South African man and his brother helped to start a software company; when the company was bought out, he owned seven percent of the common shares and made a large capital gain on the sale.
With half the money from the sale of his previous company, the entrepreneur co-founded an electronic money transfer service, which has become essential for people buying or selling products on the Internet.
As Russia and the U.S. make small steps towards easing international tensions, both sides will have many surplus missiles.
The canny entrepreneur realized that the ballistic missiles, which had once carried nuclear weapons and which the former enemies no longer needed, could easily be converted to civilian rockets for the peaceful exploration of space.
However, despite his purely peaceful intent, he was frustrated in his desire to buy some surplus missiles.
At first, the missile designers would not talk to him because they thought of him as an inexperienced novice.
When they offered to sell him a rocket for eight million dollars, he rejected the offer as too expensive.
Doing some quick back-of-the-envelope calculations, he reckoned that the raw materials actually cost less than one-thirtieth of the selling price.
One of his companies developed the Dragon spacecraft and the Falcon rocket; the former has docked with the international space station, and the latter has successfully landed on a floating platform in the ocean.
Mary expected Tom to kiss her.
That's my opinion.

This picture was painted by Tom.
Have you finished what you were doing?
Tom was relieved to see Mary.
That's pretty sad.
Tom didn't appear to be injured.
Do you think you can catch up with me?
Tom hasn't a shred of loyalty, decency or moderation.
He simply reacts to a black-and-white view of the world; he thinks you are either all for him or all against him.
If Tom senses even the slightest lack of obsequious deference, he explodes into a hail of random and spontaneous insults.
It would never occur to Tom to keep a confidence if he thought that revealing it might assuage his soap bubble of an ego.
Tom's inability to control his temper will likely instigate one international crisis after another.
His id is a minefield of hair-trigger rage, and his ego is snowflake-fragile.

That's what I got.
I told Tom I'd send him a letter.
You think you're the best, don't you?
Tom has just turned thirty.
That's what I say.

I don't know if it could get any worse than this!
There was something quite special, almost sinister to his smile.
I've tried and helped him out in everyway I could possibly think of but it seems to have made no difference whatsoever after all.
What if it was all nothing but wishful thinking? Would it make everything unreal?

I'm pretty sure Tom won't be here.

Don't worry too much. Everything is fine.
This cheesecake was too sweet.
Pretty!
We are different people.
Our mothers are strong women.
The train departed on time.
Don't feed the dog!
I can't even imagine what I would do without you.
You're not going to faint, are you?
Tom moved away from the ledge.
The hedgehog rolled up into a ball.
I won't tell anyone. I promise.

Would you guys just shut up already?
Won't you two just shut up already?
Your innocent look doesn't fool me.
Your innocent act doesn't fool me.
Don't try to play innocent.
This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.
I wasn't expecting anyone.
But after this, everything turned out well.
But it's not fair!
Would you like soup or salad as a side dish?
Tom ran as fast as his legs would take him.
You worry too much about what other people will think of you.
That's not an opinion. It's a fact.
He was struck by her beauty.
Please don't hurt him.

Tom complained that a light-fingered pilferer who'd briefly brushed against him at the crowded train station had carried off his wallet.
The landlady had told Tom: “You'd look better with a fedora hat — a light-grey felted wool one, I think. You're tall, and you could carry it off."
It was a huge party they threw, but the host and hostess carried off the event to perfection.
One day, as he was hunting deer in the forest, the prince came upon a maiden bathing in a clear pool.
The prince went to the forest to hunt and happened on a fair maiden bathing in a spring.
Once upon a time there dwelt in the land of Erin a young man who was seeking a wife, and of all the maidens round about none pleased him as well as the only daughter of a farmer.
Very soon they were married.
There was once a king who had three daughters. The two eldest were very proud and quarrelsome, but the youngest was as good as they were bad.
Once upon a time an old queen, whose husband had been dead for many years, had a beautiful daughter.
The princess was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off.
The Princess's horse was called Falada, and could speak.
When the hour for departure drew near the old mother went to her bedroom, and taking a small knife she cut her fingers till they bled; then she held a white rag under them, and letting three drops of blood fall into it, she gave it to her daughter, and said: "Dear child, take great care of this rag: it may be of use to you on the journey."
Pray get down and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder stream: I would like a drink.
"If you're thirsty," said the maid, "dismount yourself, and lie down by the water and drink; I don't mean to be your servant any longer."
If your mother only knew, her heart would surely break in two.
The waiting-maid commanded her harshly to take off her royal robes, and to put on her common ones.
There was great rejoicing over the arrival, and the Prince sprang forward to meet them, and taking the waiting-maid for his bride, he lifted her down from her horse and led her upstairs to the royal chamber.
The real Princess was left standing below in the courtyard.
The old King, who was looking out of his window, beheld her in this plight, and it struck him how sweet and gentle, even beautiful, she looked.
When they had reached the common where the geese fed, she sat down and unloosed her hair, which was of pure gold.
A gust of wind blew Curdken's hat away, and he had to chase it over hill and dale.
Curdken was very angry, and wouldn't speak to her.
They herded the geese till evening and then went home.
Curdken ran up to her and wanted to grasp some of the hair from her head.
A puff of wind came and blew Curdken's hat far away.
They watched the geese till it was dark.
I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl.
"I refuse to herd geese any longer with that girl." "For what reason?" asked the old King. "Because she does nothing but annoy me all day long," replied Curdken.
She does nothing but annoy me all day long.
Well, if you won't tell me, confide your trouble to the iron stove there.
Here I sit, deserted by all the world, I who am a king's daughter, and a false waiting- maid has forced me to take off my own clothes, and has taken my place with my bridegroom, while I have to fulfill the lowly office of goose-girl.
The old King stood outside at the stove chimney, and listened to her words.
The young King rejoiced from his heart when he saw her beauty and learned how good she was, and a great banquet was prepared, to which everyone was bidden.
She was so dazzled that she did not recognize the Princess in her glittering garments.
"What," said he, "should be done to a certain person who has deceived everyone?"
Then the false bride answered: "She deserves to be put stark naked into a barrel lined with sharp nails, which should be dragged by two white horses up and down the street till she is dead."
There's no doubt about it. He's tall.
"You are the person," said the King, "and you have passed sentence on yourself; and even so it shall be done to you."
The young King was married to his real bride, and both reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness.

Oifa drove the children of Lir into the lake to bathe, and they did as she told them. As soon as they were upon the lake she struck them with a Druid's wand of spells and wizardry and put them into the forms of four beautiful, perfectly white swans.
Out with you upon the wild waves, children of the king! Henceforth your cries shall be with the flocks of birds.
I awoke to find snow falling.
Nine hundred years shall you wander over the lakes and streams of Erin. This only I will grant unto you: that you retain your own speech, and there shall be no music in the world equal to yours, the plaintive music you shall sing.
The nobles of the court asked her where were the children of Lir.
He's your age.
It happened that the five Kings of Ireland met to determine who should have the head kingship over them, and King Lir of the Hill of the White Field expected surely he would be elected.
Have both of you already had lunch?
Have both of you already eaten lunch?
That should have never happened.

There was a poor farmer who had three sons, and on the same day the three boys went to seek their fortune.
Her hair was as red as fire.
Across the bridge, there is a little cottage.
Honor your elders.
There was once upon a time an old Queen whose husband had been dead for many years, and she had a beautiful daughter.
When the princess grew up she was betrothed to a prince who lived at a great distance.
Now that I think about it, I must look threatening.
The horse of the King's daughter was called Falada, and could speak.
I warned you not to trust me.
Have you already gone to the polls today?
The show was fun.
I told you not to do anything stupid.
Look after your little brother.
Look after your little sister.
Look after your brother while I'm gone.

I thought Tom did that pretty well.
Everything will be decided on Monday.
I know Tom isn't happy here.
It made me chuckle.

Appointed commissioners who nobody votes for and who cannot be voted out frame all the laws, and these are then merely rubber-stamped by the European parliament. It's actually scary what this could potentially mean. It's a despot's dream set-up. Very short-sighted to vote to remain.

Human-caused climate change has caused land ice to melt and ocean water to expand.
For decades scientists warned that the accelerating sea level rise would eventually put coastlines in many countries at risk.
The inundation of coastal towns has begun. The sea has risen to the point that a high tide and a brisk wind are now all it takes to send water pouring into streets and homes.
Atmospheric scientists have warned that global warming is not a hundred years off but is an immediate problem whose effects are being felt right now.
Greenland's melting is accelerating. By itself, the full melting of that country's ice sheet could increase sea levels by over six metres.
As the temperature rises, large lakes form on the surface of Greenland's ice, which in turn create a network of rivers. The rushing rivers rapidly melt through the surrounding ice like a knife cutting through butter.
Greenland's meltwater rivers flow down into giant holes in the ice, called moulins, which drain through tunnels in the ice sheet and out into the ocean.
Although arctic and antarctic ice are melting rapidly and sea levels are already rising, elected lawmakers who deny the very existence of climate change currently chair the respective science committees of both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.

A private security company released attack dogs against hundreds of Native Americans trying to prevent an oil pipeline company from using bulldozers to desecrate the graves of their ancestors.
The dogs drew blood from several protesters, including children, who were then pepper-sprayed in an unsuccessful attempt to drive them away from the construction site. Instead of arresting the security guards, the local police arrested 30 peaceful protesters, some of whom had been bitten by the fierce dogs.
Twelve-year-old Alice Brownotter ran a total distance of nearly twenty-five hundred kilometres from North Dakota to the United States capital to call for more protection of fresh water sources. "Water is life," she said, "and when the oil pipeline under the Missouri River breaks, it will affect everyone."

Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.
It is a dream come true.
Disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people.
May I ask who's speaking?
Oh, if only that were true!
It is a dive bar.
"How are we gonna find the princess with the power going out?" "Well, maybe there's a switch in one of the rooms." "How are we gonna find the switch in one of the rooms with the power going out?" "...Uh, I dunno."
I think it helps to learn to pronounce words.
What kind of music?
It is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.

Vladimir Putin said he had not been misquoted but mistranslated when he had characterized an American presidential nominee as “flamboyant.” A British newspaper had incorrectly translated that word as “brilliant”, and that report misled the candidate into assuming the Russian president had meant brilliant in an intellectual sense — a mistake the paper later corrected.

Throughout the day the weather had looked more than threatening.
I was in a few of the pictures.
Lady Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library.
I fear that the ghost exists. It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.
There is no such thing, sir, as a ghost.
If you don't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember I warned you.
Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn.
I'm earning money.
The corpus callosum connects the right and left parts of the brain.
Little squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by, and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls, with their white tails in the air.
It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods.
A great flight of rooks passed silently over their heads.
The sky became suddenly overcast with clouds.
Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in black silk, with a white cap and apron.
It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575.
He disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances.
His spirit still haunts the manor.
His body has never been discovered.
The blood-stain cannot be removed.
That is all nonsense.
"I have seen things with my own eyes, sir," she said, "that would make any Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here."
The storm raged fiercely all that night.
Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside his room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming nearer every moment.
He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock.
His eyes were as red burning coals; long grey hair fell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of antique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves.
The second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night.
Shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall.
A large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor.
Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled.
The raven croaked from the old yew-tree.
The wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul.
Virginia rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire.
I found out he was seeing someone else at the same time.
Far away beyond the pine-woods, there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale sings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold crystal moon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers.
He looks a bit fat.
Virginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.
"You mean the Garden of Death," she whispered.
Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forget life, to be at peace.
I'm pretty tired from last night.
She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.
Then the ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind.
Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?
You will see fearful shapes in darkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not harm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell cannot prevail.
I have enjoyed reading this novel a lot.
Suddenly she stood up, very pale, and with a strange light in her eyes.
"I am not afraid," she said firmly, "and I will ask the angel to have mercy on you."
About ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea.
Right after the accident, I was in a state of shock.
"What an angel you are!" cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round her neck, and kissed her.
Do you want cheese in your eggs?
The hearse was drawn by eight black horses.
The leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms.
Do you always listen to my phone calls?
Since when do you listen to my phone calls?
A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard, just under the old yew-tree.
The accident was a traumatizing experience.
I can't picture you traumatized.
These gems are of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price.
Mary was enraged when she found out about the baby.
I can't fathom why somebody would make something like that up.
What are we dealing with here?
They were both so charming, and they loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the match.
Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.
Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.
Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you.
He made me see what Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than both.
The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.
You can have your secret as long as I have your heart.
"Guess what happened to me today!" "Don't tell me; you found a coin on the ground." "Yes! How did you know?" "That's what you always tell me after you say that."
It seems that we are fresh out of tea.
I finally received the call I had been waiting for for weeks.
Ken has memorized a large number of Japanese songs.

Maria sings as off-key as a cat.
The ghost has been seen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a fellow of King's College, Cambridge.
He was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes.
He was as popular with men as he was with women, and he had every accomplishment except that of making money.
To make matters worse, he was in love.
The girl he loved was Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his digestion in India, and had never found either of them again.
Laura adored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings.
They were the handsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them.
The Colonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.
When he took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly sought after.
The only people a painter should know are people who are bête and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an intellectual repose to talk to.
Men who are dandies and women who are darlings rule the world, at least they should do so.
'My dear boy,' said Trevor, smiling, 'that old beggar, as you call him, is one of the richest men in Europe. He could buy all London tomorrow without overdrawing his account. He has a house in every capital, dines off gold plate, and can prevent Russia going to war when he chooses.'
The old man you saw today in the studio was Baron Hausberg. He is a great friend of mine, buys all my pictures and that sort of thing, and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as a beggar.
An old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the room, and said, in a slight French accent, 'Have I the honour of addressing Monsieur Erskine?'
He's already drunk three cups of coffee.

For months afterwards he would hear her continual tears and wailing. He decided to leave general practice and to specialize as an oculist.
My aunt’s house is old. It was previously a farmstead, but its location is now in a suburban part of town. However, the garden surrounding it still imparts a rural appearance.

Rome, thou art a whole world, it is true, and yet without love this world would not be the world, Rome would cease to be Rome.
All in the golden afternoon / Full leisurely we glide; / For both our oars, with little skill, / By little arms are plied, / While little hands make vain pretence / Our wanderings to guide.
Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour. / Beneath such dreamy weather. / To beg a tale of breath too weak / To stir the tiniest feather! / Yet what can one poor voice avail / Against three tongues together?
Imperious Prima flashes forth / Her edict "to begin it"— / In gentler tone Secunda hopes / "There will be nonsense in it!"— / While Tertia interrupts the tale / Not more than once a minute.
Anon, to sudden silence won, / In fancy they pursue / The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new, / In friendly chat with bird or beast— / And half believe it true.
And ever, as the story drained / The wells of fancy dry, / And faintly strove that weary one / To put the subject by, / "The rest next time—" "It is next time!" / The happy voices cry.
Thus grew the tale of Wonderland: / Thus slowly, one by one, / Its quaint events were hammered out— / And now the tale is done, / And home we steer, a merry crew, / Beneath the setting sun.
Alice! a childish story take, / And with a gentle hand / Lay it where Childhood's dreams are twined / In Memory's mystic band, / Like pilgrim's wither'd wreath of flowers / Pluck'd in a far-off land.
Everything was in confusion in the Oblonskys' house.
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty / enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus: Alexander died, / Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is / earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam (whereto he / was converted) might they not stop a beer barrel? / Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, / Might stop a hole to keep the wind away. / O, that that earth which kept the world in awe / Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!

"What do you want for Christmas?" "I don't know."
Music is the most perishable of things, fragile and delicate, easily destroyed.
My major preoccupation is the question, 'What is reality?'
You saw something you were not supposed to see.
Writing is a lonely way of life. You shut yourself up in your study and work and work.
For each person there is a sentence — a series of words — which has the power to destroy him … another sentence exists, another series of words, which will heal the person.
It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.
Mental illness is not funny.
Each of us assumes everyone else knows what he is doing. They all assume we know what we are doing. We don't.
Nothing is going on and nobody knows what it is.
Nobody is concealing anything except the fact that he does not understand anything anymore and wishes he could go home.
Can virtue exist without sin?
The electric things have their life too. Paltry as those lives are.
No one today remembered why the war had come about or who, if anyone, had won. The dust which had contaminated most of the planet’s surface had originated in no country, and no one, even the wartime enemy, had planned on it.
Doctor Labyrinth, like most people who read a great deal and who have too much time on their hands, had become convinced that our civilization was going the way of Rome. He saw, I think, the same cracks forming that had sundered the ancient world, the world of Greece and Rome; and it was his conviction that presently our world, our society, would pass away as theirs did, and a period of darkness would follow.
Science has given us more lives than it has taken; we must remember that.
What we speak of as 'causality' is nothing more than the phenomenon of repetition.
Spinoza saw, and I think with great profundity, that if a falling stone could reason, it would think, ‘‘I want to fall at the rate of thirty-two feet per second per second.’’ Freewill for us - that is, when we feel desire, when we are conscious of wanting to do what we do - may be even for us an illusion.
Assumptions are the things you don’t know you’re making.
Privacy is as necessary as company; you can drive a man crazy by depriving him of either.
Man is not a rational animal; he is a rationalizing animal.
The capacity of the human mind for swallowing nonsense and spewing it forth in violent and repressive action has never yet been plumbed.
The death rate is the same for us as for anybody ... one person, one death, sooner or later.
How you behave toward cats here below determines your status in Heaven.
Neither ‘common sense’ nor ‘logic’ can prove anything. Proof comes from experiment, or to put it another way, from experience, and from nothing else.
I don't have any artistic talent.
If you would know a man, observe how he treats a cat.
Nobody ever wins a lawsuit but the lawyers.
This investigation can act as a foundation for more comprehensive research.
Cats have no sense of humor, they have terribly inflated egos, and they are very touchy.
The more complicated the law the more opportunity for scoundrels.
Age is not an accomplishment, and youth is not a sin.
Life is short, but the years are long.
Love is the condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.
Jealousy is a disease; love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often confuses one for the other, or assumes the greater the love, the greater the jealousy. In fact they are almost incompatible; both at once produce unbearable turmoil.
Progress doesn't come from early risers — progress is made by lazy men looking for easier ways to do things.
A generation which ignores history has no past—and no future.
Never underestimate the power of human stupidity.
You live and learn. Or you don't live long.
Each generation thinks it invented sex; each generation is totally mistaken.
Anyone who considers protocol unimportant has never dealt with a cat.
I think all cats are wild. They only act tame if there's a saucer of milk in it for them.
Nothing's more playful than a young cat, nor more grave than an old one.
The cat is a wild animal that inhabits the homes of humans.
In ancient times cats were worshiped as gods; they have not forgotten this.
When a man loves cats, I am his friend and comrade, without further introduction.
If animals could speak, the dog would be a blundering outspoken fellow; but the cat would have the rare grace of never saying a word too much.
When there was room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was there — in sunny weather — stretched at full length, asleep and blissful, with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A home without a cat—and a well-fed, well-petted, and properly revered cat—may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?

Yesterday, my boyfriend told me he'd heard that beautiful women love to be called intelligent, and intelligent women love to be called beautiful. Then he added, "So you must love it that people call you both." In your opinion, how am I supposed to feel about that?

How do you expect me to know that? I'm not a psychic.
I don't know anyone I could speak Chinese with.

How long were you in Japan?
Could it have been a murder?

This law was written in an unconstitutional way.
I'd love to overcome my inferiority complex.
I've suffered from an inferiority complex for several years.
Inferiority complexes are more common than we think.

Out in the forest stood a pretty little Fir Tree.
The little Fir Tree wished ardently to become greater.
"Oh, if I were only as great a tree as the others!" sighed the little Fir.
When it was winter, and the snow lay all around, white and sparkling, a hare would often come jumping along, and spring right over the little Fir Tree. Oh! this made him so angry.
In the autumn woodcutters always came and felled a few of the largest trees; that was done this year too, and the little Fir Tree, that was now quite well grown, shuddered with fear, for the great stately trees fell to the ground with a crash, and their branches were cut off.
All around the walls hung pictures, and by the great stove stood large Chinese vases with lions on the covers; there were rocking-chairs, silken sofas, great tables covered with picture-books, and toys worth a hundred times a hundred dollars, at least the children said so.
Oh, how the Tree trembled!
The servants, and the young ladies also, decked out the tree. On one branch they hung little nets, cut out of colored paper; every net was filled with sweetmeats; golden apples and walnuts hung down as if they grow there, and more than a hundred little candles, red, white, and blue, were fastened to the different boughs.
High on the summit of the Tree was fixed a tinsel star. It was splendid, particularly splendid.
"Heaven preserve us!" cried the young ladies; and they hastily put the fire out.
The little ones stood quite silent, but only for a minute; then they shouted till the room rang: they danced gleefully round the Tree, and one present after another was plucked from it.
"A story! a story!" shouted the children.
And the servant came and chopped the Tree into little pieces.
At each explosion, which was a deep sigh, the Tree thought of a summer day in the woods, or of a winter night there, when the stars beamed; he thought of Christmas-eve and of Klumpey-Dumpey, the only story he had ever heard or knew how to tell; and then the Tree was burned.
The boys played in the garden, and the youngest had on his breast a golden star, which the Tree had worn on its happiest evening. Now that was past, and the Tree’s life was past, and the story is past too: past! past!—and that's the way with all stories.
Please tell me the truth: is there a Santa Claus?
In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy.
Alas! how dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus!
Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies!
You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on Christmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see.
Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that's no proof that they are not there.
Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.
You may tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart.
From the center of the ceiling of this kitchen, old Wardle had just suspended with his own hands a huge branch of mistletoe.
"This," said Mr. Pickwick, looking round him, "this is, indeed, comfort."
Up flew the bright sparks in myriads as the logs were stirred, and the deep red blaze sent forth a rich glow, that penetrated into the furthest corner of the room, and cast its cheerful tint on every face.
Was there ever a wider or more loving conspiracy than that which keeps the venerable figure of Santa Claus from slipping away, with all the other oldtime myths, into the forsaken wonderland of the past?
Of all the personages whose marvelous doings once filled the minds of men, he alone survives. He has outlived all the great gods, and all the impressive and poetic conceptions which once flitted between heaven and earth; these have gone, but Santa Claus remains by virtue of a common understanding that childhood shall not be despoiled of one of its most cherished beliefs.
Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love!
After dinner, eaten, let it be confessed, with more haste and less accompaniment of talk than usual, the parlor doors were opened, and there stood the Christmas tree in a glow of light, its wonderful branches laden with all manner of strange fruits.
The fire has burned low, and a soft and solemn light fills the room. Neither of us speaks while the clock strikes twelve. I look out of the window. The heavens are ablaze with light, and somewhere amid those circling constellations I know that a new star has found its place, and is shining with such a ray as never before fell from heaven to earth.
All the house was asleep, and the fire burning low, when, from far up the chimney, came down a "Ho! ho!".
His friends called him Santa Claus; and those who were most intimate ventured to say, "Old Nick."
The baby stared, and thrust his fist into his mouth.
With his lace and embroideries, and his crown of blue ribbon and whalebone, he looked like the king of babies.
Mevrouw commenced playing softly upon the piano.

The door slowly opened; and St. Nicholas, in full array, stood before them.
Everyone had gifts, from grandfather down to the baby.
On a bright December morning long ago, two thinly clad children were kneeling upon the bank of a frozen canal in Holland.
His mother was a poor peasant woman, too poor even to think of such a thing as buying skates for her little ones.
We dreamed of Santa Claus, or if we awoke in the night, we listened for the jingling of his sleigh-bells.
At the peep of day we were aroused by the voice of my good grandfather, who planted himself in the stairway and shouted in a stentorian tone, "I wish you all a Merry Christmas!".
I remember that I once received an autograph letter from Santa Claus, full of good counsels.
Happy days of childish credulity, when fact and fiction were swallowed alike without a misgiving!
When I became a parent, my beloved wife and I, determined to make the Christmastide one of the golden days of the twelve months.
In mid-winter, when all outside vegetation was bleak and bare, the Christmas-tree in our parlor bloomed in many-colored beauty and bounty.
When the tiny candles were all lighted the children and our domestics gathered round it.
This, then, is Christmas, 1862. Everything is silent in Dreamthorp. The smith's hammer reposes beside the anvil. The weaver's flying shuttle is at rest.
Through the clear wintry sunshine the bells this morning rang from the gray church tower amid the leafless elms, and up the walk the villagers trooped in their best dresses and their best faces — the latter a little reddened by the sharp wind: mere redness in the middle aged; in the maids, wonderful bloom to the eyes of their lovers — and took their places decently in the ancient pews.
I have no one with me at table, and my own thoughts must be my Christmas guests.
The face of Christmas glows all the brighter for the cold.
The heart warms as the frost increases.
There is more charity at this time than at any other.
By this time I should think every Christmas dinner at Dreamthorp or elsewhere has come to an end.
Soon, in the great theatre, the lights will be put out, and the empty stage will be left to ghosts.
I look out on the brilliant heaven, and see a milky way of powdery splendour wandering through it, and clusters and knots of stars and planets shining serenely in the blue frosty spaces; and the armed apparition of Orion, his spear pointing away into immeasurable space, gleaming overhead; and the familiar constellation of the Plough dipping down into the west; and I think when I go in again that there is one Christmas the less between me and my grave.
Hark! midnight from the church tower vibrates through the frosty air.
I don't think Tom needs to worry.

The wind roared and shouted around the house, and the snow fell steadily half the year, so that the summers never melted it away till winter came again.
And Santa Claus thought that was the greatest pleasure in life: for he loved to have enormous fires in the great fire-places, and the colder it was, the bigger fires he would have, and the louder the winds roared around his chimney.
There he sat and worked away all the year round, making dolls, and soldiers, and Noah’s arks, and witches, and every other sort of toy you can think of.
When Christmas Eve came he’d harness up his reindeers, Dasher, and Prancer, and Vixen, and the rest of them, and wrap himself up in furs, and light his big pipe, and cram his sled full of the doll-babies and Noah’s arks, and all the other toys he’d been making, and off he’d go with a great shout and tremendous ringing of sleigh-bells.
Before morning he'd be up and down every chimney in New Amsterdam, filling the stout grey yarn stockings with toys, and apples, and ginger-bread, laughing and chuckling so all the while, that the laughs and chuckles didn't get out of the air for a week afterwards.
She married him for his money, and couldn’t put up with his plain way of living.
What would Ma say if she knew you associated with such common people!
He tumbles down all the poor people's chimneys, and fills up the stockings to overflowing.
Away up in the fourth-story of his grand house, where his wife never goes, St. Nicholas has a little workshop, and there he sits whenever he gets a chance, making the most wonderful dolls, and gorgeous soldiers, and miraculous jumping-jacks, and tin horns.
Christmas is the birthday of one whose chief contribution to the human heart and mind was his message of boundless, universal love. He brought to the world the greatest thing in the world and that is why the season of his birth has won such an intimate place in our heart.
The pagan nations of antiquity always had a tendency to worship the sun, under different names, as the giver of light and life. And their festivals in its honor took place near the winter solstice, the shortest day in the year, when the sun in December begins its upward course, thrilling men with the first distant promise of spring.
This holiday was called Saturnalia among the Romans and was marked by great merriment and licence which extended even to the slaves.
There were feasting and gifts and the houses were hung with evergreens.
A more barbarous form of these rejoicings took place among the rude peoples of the north where great blocks of wood blazed in honor of Odin and Thor, and sacrifices of men and cattle were made to them. Mistletoe was cut then from the sacred oaks with a golden sickle by the Prince of the Druids.
The ancient Goths and Saxons called this festival Yule.
The ancient Teutons celebrated the season by decking a fir tree, for they thought of the sun, riding higher and higher in the heavens, as the spreading and blossoming of a great tree.
Thus our own Christmas fir was decked as a symbol of the celestial sun tree. The lights, according to Professor Schwartz, represent the flashes of lightning overhead, the golden apples, nuts and balls symbolize the sun, the moon and the stars, while the little animals hung in the branches betoken sacrifices made in gratitude to the sun god.
With the rise of Puritanism the very existence of Christmas was threatened.
Puritanism brought over with it in the Mayflower the anti-Christmas feeling to New England.
The king protested.
The General Court of Massachusetts followed the example of the English Parliament in 1659 when it enacted that ' anybody who is found observing, by abstinence from labor, feasting, or any other way, any such day as Christmas day, shall pay for every such offense five shillings.'
There are many superstitions connected with the coming of Christmas itself. The bees are said to sing, the cattle to kneel, in honor of the manger, and the sheep to go in procession in commemoration of the visit of the angel to the shepherds.
Howison in his "Sketches of Upper Canada" relates that on one moonlit Christmas Eve he saw an Indian creeping cautiously through the woods.
In the German Alps it is believed that the cattle have the gift of language on Christmas Eve. But it is a sin to attempt to play the eavesdropper upon them.
No other holiday has so rich an heritage of old customs and observances as Christmas.
The Yule Log has from time immemorial been haled to the open fire-place on Christmas Eve, and lighted with the embers of its predecessor to sanctify the roof-tree and protect it against those evil spirits over whom the season is in everyway a triumph.
Stockings are hung for Santa Claus to fill during the night.
Mistletoe is commonly used as a Christmas decoration.
According to an old Christmas custom, if a woman is caught standing under hanging mistletoe, a man may kiss her.
The mistletoe is still hung up in farm-houses and kitchens at Christmas, and the young men have the privilege of kissing the girls under it, plucking each time a berry from the bush. When the berries are all plucked the privilege ceases.

After turning from the main road up a narrow lane, so thickly shaded with forest-trees as to give it a complete air of seclusion, we came in sight of the cottage.
A small wicket-gate opened upon a footpath that wound through some shrubbery to the door.
A bright beautiful face glanced out at the window, and vanished--a light footstep-was heard--and Mary came tripping forth to meet us.

A house without books is like a room without windows.
A house without books is like a room without windows. No man has a right to bring up his children without surrounding them with books, if he has the means to buy them. It is a wrong to his family. He cheats them! Children learn to read by being in the presence of books. The love of knowledge comes with reading and grows upon it.
Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else.
Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.

I was the only person in the whole theater that was alone.
The handsome dining-room at the club looked bright, but it was empty.
Who dines at this club on Christmas but lonely bachelors?
The white, snowy cloths, the rich window-hangings, the warm tints of the walls, the sparkle of the fire in the steel grate, gave the room an air of elegance and cheerfulness.
The table at which I dined was close to the window.
Snow began whirling through the street.
There was a storm, and snow began whirling through the street.
It was a pale, wild, haggard face, in a great cloud of black hair, pressed against the glass.
I finished the wine and set down the glass.
It was only a beggar-girl that had crept up to the window and stole a glance at the bright scene within.
The pale face troubled me a little.
I filled my glass once more with wine, and was again about to drink, when the face reappeared at the window.
The face was was so white, so thin, with eyes so large, wild, and hungry-looking, and the black, unkempt hair, into which the snow had drifted, formed so strange and weird a frame to the picture, that I was fairly startled.
The storm had increased, and the snow was driving in wild gusts through the streets.
I could not repress a keen thrill of sympathy for the child, whoever it was, whose only Christmas was to watch, in cold and storm, the rich banquet ungratefully enjoyed by the lonely bachelor.
I resumed my place at the table; but the dinner was finished, and the wine had no further relish.
I was haunted by the vision at the window.
I kept thinking, thinking of the pale, haggard, lonely little girl on the cold and desolate side of the window-pane.
I drank glass after glass of the wine—not that I enjoyed its flavor any more, but mechanically, as it were, and with a sort of hope thereby to drown unpleasant reminders.
I rose once in a while and went to the window, but could see no one to whom the pale face could have belonged.
Just as I was raising a glass of wine to my lips, I was startled by a picture at the window-pane. It was a pale, wild, haggard face, in a great cloud of black hair, pressed against the glass. As I looked, it vanished.
Isn't the Christmas festival just simply wonderful?
I always buy things I'd like to have myself.

The most solemn responsibility for any President is keeping the American people safe.
We are a nation that stands for the rule of law.
We’re a nation that believes freedom can never be taken for granted and that each of us has a responsibility to sustain it.
The universal right to speak your mind and to protest against authority, to live in a society that’s open and free, that can criticize a President without retribution -- a country where you're judged by the content of your character rather than what you look like, or how you worship, or what your last name is, or where your family came from -- that's what separates us from tyrants and terrorists.

The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought.
Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.
Take "good", for instance. If you have a word like "good", what need is there for a word like "bad"? "Ungood" will do just as well — better, because it's an exact opposite, which the other is not.
Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.
The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy — everything.
If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever.
No one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.

Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
Everything that can go wrong will go wrong.
Anything that can possibly go wrong, does.
If anything can go wrong, it will.
Anything that can go wrong, will—at the worst possible moment.
Hope for the best, expect the worst.
Murphy's law states that whatever can go wrong will go wrong.
When you toss a coin, the more strongly you want heads, the more likely it is to come up tails.
My computer crashed just as I was about to hit "send".
Microsoft Word crashes whenever I try to save.
Save frequently.
Misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world than trickery and malice. At any rate, the last two are certainly much less frequent.
Let us not attribute to malice and cruelty what may be referred to less criminal motives. Do we not often afflict others undesignedly, and, from mere carelessness, neglect to relieve distress?

I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.
We see things only as we are constructed to see them, and can gain no idea of their absolute nature.
With five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos, yet other beings with wider, stronger, or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see, but might see and study whole worlds of matter, energy, and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have.
Disintegration is quite painless, I assure you.
No new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace.
The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.
The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.
Life has never interested me so much as the escape from life.
Men will always tremble at the thought of the hidden and fathomless worlds of strange life which may pulsate in the gulfs beyond the stars.
I am writing this under an appreciable mental strain, since by tonight I shall be no more. Penniless, and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable, I can bear the torture no longer; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below.

It was in mid-summer, when the alchemy of Nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green; when the senses are well-nigh intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation.
In such surroundings the mind loses its perspective; time and space become trivial and unreal, and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness.
All day I had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow; thinking thoughts I need not discuss, and conversing with things I need not name.
When, upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers, I suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault, I had no knowledge of what I had discovered.
As I closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle, I seemed to know the way.
Here I would lie outstretched on the mossy ground, thinking strange thoughts and dreaming of strange dreams.
A favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down.
At last came that which I had long feared.
The mansion, gone for a century, once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles.
Inside the hall were music, laughter, and wine on every hand.
Red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house.
In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.
Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.
Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.
Once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.
As I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.
High up, crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mound whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest, stands the old chateau of my ancestors.

Our economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class.
While the top one percent has amassed a bigger share of wealth and income, too many families, in inner cities and in rural counties, have been left behind.
Stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic ideal.
The next wave of economic dislocations won't come from overseas. It will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete.
If we don't create opportunity for all people, the disaffection and division that has stalled our progress will only sharpen in years to come.
After my election, there was talk of a post-racial America. And such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic.
Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.
I've lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10, or 20, or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say. You can see it not just in statistics, you see it in the attitudes of young Americans across the political spectrum.
Social attitudes oftentimes take generations to change.
If our democracy is to work in this increasingly diverse nation, then each one of us need to try to heed the advice of a great character in American fiction — Atticus Finch — who said: "You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."
Increasingly, we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.
Politics is a battle of ideas.
Without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent might be making a fair point, and that science and reason matter then we're going to keep talking past each other, and we'll make common ground and compromise impossible.
How can elected officials rage about deficits when we propose to spend money on preschool for kids, but not when we're cutting taxes for corporations?
As my mother used to tell me, reality has a way of catching up with you.
In just eight years, we've halved our dependence on foreign oil; we've doubled our renewable energy; we've led the world to an agreement that has the promise to save this planet.
Without bolder action, our children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change. They'll be busy dealing with its effects: more environmental disasters, more economic disruptions, waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary.
We can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem. But to simply deny the problem not only betrays future generations, it betrays the essential spirit of this country — the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem-solving that guided our Founders.
It's that spirit—a faith in reason, and enterprise, and the primacy of right over might—that allowed us to resist the lure of fascism and tyranny during the Great Depression; that allowed us to build a post-World War II order with other democracies, an order based not just on military power or national affiliations but built on principles—the rule of law, human rights, freedom of religion, and speech, and assembly, and an independent press.
Our democracy is threatened whenever we take it for granted. All of us, regardless of party, should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions.
When voting rates in America are some of the lowest among advanced democracies, we should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.
When trust in our institutions is low, we should reduce the corrosive influence of money in our politics, and insist on the principles of transparency and ethics in public service.
When Congress is dysfunctional, we should draw our congressional districts to encourage politicians to cater to common sense and not rigid extremes.
In his own farewell address, George Washington wrote that self-government is the underpinning of our safety, prosperity, and liberty, but "from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken…to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth."
It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy; to embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours.
For all our outward differences, we, in fact, all share the same proud title, the most important office in a democracy: Citizen.
If you're disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.
My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you.
May God continue to bless the United States of America.

Moving away to a foreign country is a big chance in anybody's life. Have you talked this over with your parents yet?
Due to my health issues and business interests, I will not be able to make it.
A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable.
Just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others.
A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife.
I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century.
The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent. That's unprecedented. And it's not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth.
The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device.
In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.
The collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.
In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach.
Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict.
Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities.
Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down.
We see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information.
Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims.
An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power.
Our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.
I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress.
In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.
As too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle transnational challenges.
Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.
So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions -- economic, political, and cultural -- that are caused by integration are squarely addressed.
It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top.
While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage.
In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared.
Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.
In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment.
Global capital is too often unaccountable—nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.
We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box.
The stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end.
After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were capturing more than 90 percent of income growth. But today, that's down to about half.
Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years.
That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation -- because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.
That’s why we’ve pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they're fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.
For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods.
I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe.
It's not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do.
And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we don't act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.
There appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now.
I believe in a liberal political order -- an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies. And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we've learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave.
My belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story.
Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.
Too often, in capitals, decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.
We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.
I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray.
As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth.
I’ve noticed as President that at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington -- and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.
I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years -- and I’ve acknowledged some -- we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.
We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.
We can't combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders -- mosquitos don't respect walls -- unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola -- by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure.
We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper.
Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children -- including our girls -- the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
Sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action -- not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term -- enhances our security. And I think that's not just true for us.
Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe.
And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.
We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us.
We still have a lot to discuss.

There's a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes and ethnic groups and nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.
Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that's our fate.
We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war. But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again.
Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history.
Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that, "Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God."
During the course of these eight years, as I've traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.
My own family is made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world -- just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore.
And in my own life, in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They don’t have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.
This is what I believe: that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.

The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.
Strange is our situation here upon earth. Each of us comes for a short visit, not knowing why, yet sometimes seeming to divine a purpose.
From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that man is here for the sake of other men —above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy.
Schopenhauer’s saying— “A man can surely do what he wills to do, but he cannot determine what he wills”—impressed itself upon me in youth and has always consoled me when I have witnessed or suffered life’s hardships.
To ponder interminably over the reason for one’s own existence or the meaning of life in general seems to me, from an objective point of view, to be sheer folly.
I have never belonged wholeheartedly to country or state, to my circle of friends, or even to my own family. These ties have always been accompanied by a vague aloofness, and the wish to withdraw into myself increases with the years.
My political ideal is democracy. Everyone should be respected as an individual, but no one idolized. It is an irony of fate that I should have been showered with so much uncalled for and unmerited admiration and esteem. Perhaps this adulation springs from the unfulfilled wish of the multitude to comprehend the few ideas which I, with my weak powers, have advanced.
To know that what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms— this knowledge, this feeling, is at the center of true religiousness. In this sense, and in this sense only, I belong in the ranks of devoutly religious men.
I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modeled after our own—a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty.
It is enough for me to contemplate the mystery of conscious life perpetuating itself through all eternity, to reflect upon the marvelous structure of the universe which we can dimly perceive, and to try humbly to comprehend even an infinitesimal part of the intelligence manifested in nature.

Our pursuit of human rights is part of a broad effort to use our great power and our tremendous influence in the service of creating a better world, a world in which human beings can live in peace, in freedom, and with their basic needs adequately met.
Human rights is the soul of our foreign policy.
History teaches, perhaps, very few clear lessons. But surely one such lesson learned by the world at great cost is that aggression, unopposed, becomes a contagious disease.
Our commitment to human rights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved; the powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be enhanced.

A deficit is when you have less than when you had nothing.

War may sometimes be a necessary evil. But no matter how necessary, it is always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together in peace by killing each other's children.
Without truth, without trust, America cannot flourish. Trust is at the very heart of our democracy, the sacred covenant between a president and the people. When that trust is violated, the bonds that hold our republic together begin to weaken.

I’m President of the United States and I’m not going to eat any more broccoli.
We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order, a world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
When we are successful, and we will be, we have a real chance at this new world order, an order in which a credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the U.N.'s founders.
We have in this past year made great progress in ending the long era of conflict and cold war.
Think about every problem, every challenge, we face. The solution to each starts with education.
Trying to eliminate Saddam, extending the ground war into an occupation of Iraq, would have violated our guideline about not changing objectives in midstream, engaging in "mission creep", and would have incurred incalculable human and political costs.
No nation can fully understand itself or find its place in the world if it does not look with clear eyes at all the glories and disgraces, too, of the past. We, in the United States, acknowledge such an injustice in our own history: The internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry was a great injustice, and it will never be repeated.
We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it better.
The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree.
A new breeze is blowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on.
There are times when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow.
We know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is right.
I do not mistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are large, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will is greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.
There's a letter for you.
Tom is away on a ski trip for the weekend.
Tom scalded his arm.
I scalded myself with boiling water from the kettle.
Tom was obviously impressed.
He was obviously impressed.
She was obviously impressed.
I should pay more attention.
Let's get takeout.
Tom and Mary are studying together in the library.
Do you want to come over to my place and watch a movie or something?
I wore my favorite dress.
I like her and she likes me.
I like him and he likes me.
The punishment must fit the crime.
I can't stand my roommate.
The tax code is too complex.
We have not come this far without a struggle and I assure you we cannot go further without a struggle.
For twelve years this Nation was afflicted with hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Government. The Nation looked to Government but the Government looked away.
When they realized that she was breathing normally, they took her off the danger list.
Maybe you can find the replacement parts you need in a salvage yard.
We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace—business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.
Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.
The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country.
Through much of the last century, America’s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.
That poodle has an immaculate pedigree, with illustrious ancestors on both sides stretching back generations.
The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth.
And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.
This is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.
Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small.
The judiciary should not become merely an extension of the legislative branch.
America, at its best, is compassionate. In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation’s promise.
Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.
I can only hypothesize that he came here for the necklace.
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.
Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.
We must confront the scandal of illiteracy in America, seen most clearly in high-poverty schools, where nearly 70 percent of fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level.
We must address the low standing of America test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science.
When we see social needs in America, my administration will look first to faith-based programs and community groups, which have proven their power to save and change lives.
Many people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.
I plan to go skiing next weekend.

Don't give him any of that soup.
Go home immediately.

What if I don't pass?

You're grounded for a week.
He's new around here.
I should have paid more attention in school.
Thanks for speaking up for me.
I'd like to explain some things for you.

Why don't you take a break, Jim?
He wants to play next.
You've beaten me six times.

Tom is a very clever student.
I'm interested in learning French.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to ask Mary to do that.
I can help you do that if you like.
Tom is a teacher and so am I.
I wonder what's going on here.
What's going on, Sarah?
They should be here soon.
We're coming to the rescue.
I'm just doing my job, Jim.
He knows me already.
Since he knows me already, I'll introduce you to him.
Is that so weird?

That must be Jamal.
You're Jim, right?
Wait. I wanna talk to you.
He doesn't even want to speak to me.
Nice work, Jim.
That must be Jenny.
Let's call him now.

I'm sorry guys. Maybe next time.
Jim is so dirty.
You're Tom, right?
I'm so tired today.
I'm Jim's friend, Tom.
Hey! Wait!
What's wrong with you, guys?

"It's nothing." "It's not nothing."
He thinks he's too good for us.
There he is. Do you see him?

I could force you to help Tom, but I don't really want to.
I did some shopping on my way home.
Tom is a highly-educated man.
I don't know whose bicycle this is.
I didn't know we were supposed to help Tom move yesterday.
I don't think anything can be done.
Tom hurried to catch the bus.
I don't think it's going to happen.
I heard that Tom didn't sing very often when he was a kid.
It's me, Jim.
Is he really ignoring me?
Did you hear me call your name?
I can't hear you very well. Can you speak up?
Did you hear Layla call your name?
I knew it, Jim! I knew it!
It's a shame, because I really wanted to play.
I yelled at him by mistake and I felt really bad.
They think you did all that stuff on purpose.
I've always been alone.
You don't want to go through so much trouble fo me, do you?
What? No way!

Where did Tom learn how to sing like that?
How's your golf game?
Tom filled the box with apples.
Don't you ever get bored singing the same songs every night?
I see no reason why you shouldn't ask Tom to go to Boston with you.
How do I know that you're not just telling me what I want to hear?
Why is Tom resigning?
I value your opinion.
What's the real reason you don't like Tom?
How are your children?
Tom filled the cup to the brim.
Did you have to wear a uniform when you were in high school?
Tom didn't have enough time to do everything that he wanted to do.
How would you feel if someone said something like that about you?
How could Tom do this?
I was probably wrong.
We're going to have to ask Tom to help us.
How great is the risk?
Tom finished third in the race.
It's going to be difficult for us to get this done by 2:30.
I'd really like to know why Tom didn't do what we asked him to do.
How would you feel if my father said we couldn't go out together?
How did Tom apologize?
I intend to stay here.
We waited all afternoon for Tom to arrive.
How many are too many?
Tom found a job that he can do.
It was a lot of fun singing for the kids at the orphanage.
I think it'd be better if you didn't go drinking with Tom tonight.
How much more money do we need to spend to complete this project?
Tom seems to enjoy putting people down.
I'm tired of your diarrheal logorrhoea.
Tom seems to enjoy insulting people.
You'll never know the truth about me.
Tom eats a lot of chocolate.
Tom's mother told him that he shouldn't eat so much chocolate.
He didn't show any remorse for his actions.
Can I put forth a question?
I cried when Tom left.
I like riding my bike.
Tom told Mary that she should work harder.
How tough is your job?
Tom found a way to get it done.
Do you think you could handle that kind of responsibility?
I don't think Tom will be able to do what you're asking him to do.
How many years did it take you before you were fluent in French?
I know we'll find Tom.
I want you to do that.
Well, let's see! And then, what next?
Jamal is always so nice to me.
They're planning to visit the city late this afternoon.
I'm feeling a little sick.
My engine is out.
What can I do now?
The train must be coming.
What's this noise? Is it a train?
Hold this, please.
There he comes.
Why are you being towed by a bus?
The brave man over there saved my life.
I think that he's the world's most courageous fire fighter.
I'm proud to have you as my friend.
Are you Jamal Sadiq? I'm a big fan!
I have someone special to introduce you, too.
Jamal isn't just an ordinary man anymore.
I'm looking forward to working with you, Jamal.
I'm a famous person now.
Are we famous now?
I can't believe it. It's Fadil.
You sound tired today.
Oh, my back.
Could you hurry it back? I'm a bit busy.
Let's go, Jamal.
Oh, he left.
I missed my stop.
I shouldn't be doing this all the time.
Jamal, what are you doing here?
I'm here to give you a special offer.
You'll be staying with me at a luxurious logde.
We'll be having a press conference tomorrow morning, so get ready for your big speech.
It must be disappointing to leave.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Jamal.
It is a great opportunity, but I don't want to leave my friends.
Let's go to the car wash.
What should I do, Jamal?
Why are you up so late?
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
It's not my working hour.
My mom must be worried.
Could you give me a ride home?
"Are you sick?" "No. Why are you asking that?"
Jamal gives me a ride every day.
Tom must be worried.
"I should thank you." "What for?"
I'm sure Tom must be worried.
Can we start if you're ready?
We'll start the press conference.
How do you feel about that now?
I would like to thank Fadil for offering me such a great chance.
That's where I wanna be.
That's where I wanna live.
He must have said it by accident.
That's where I want to live.
That's where I want to be.
This is a great chance for you.
I've already made up my mind, Jamal.
Thank you for staying.
We can begin if you're ready.
We can start if you're ready.
I'm so happy that you're staying.
I'll count on you like always.
I think it's better for Fadil to stay here.
I'm happy so long as he's happy.
It's been a busy day today.
Do you wanna come with me?
I'm a little tired, actually.
Sorry. I didn't know you were here.
I think it would be better if Tom stayed here with us.
So who's this guy?
Tom told Mary that she should lose weight.
How would you do this?
Tom gave me a penetrating gaze.
It's been three years since I graduated from high school.
Tom thought it wouldn't be safe for Mary to walk home by herself.
How long do you think you'll need to finish writing this report?
Tom came here by taxi.
I wish we'd done that.
Tom says he'll never sing in public again.
How busy are you today?
This is my friend, Jamal.
Come to play with me.
Let's play tag together.
Stop right there, I said.
Why isn't Jamal playing with us?
This game seems a bit dangerous.
I'm gonna show you something funny. Watch.
This game is so noisy.
Come outside and play with us.
I need to go to school fast.
Let me on.
I told you how to do it.
Tom gave me your email address.
Do you think you should be doing that without permission?
I thought I told you I didn't want you to talk to Tom about that.
Let's go to school for now.
How can I make sure that this won't happen to me or my parents?
Tom died from cholera.
I won't do this again.
Tom probably thought I wouldn't like this.
How can we help people?
Tom got a chance to start over.
We have a lot of equipment that no one knows how to use.
My towing rack is broken.
There are many different buildings in our town.
What's that place?
You have to be quiet in class.
Do you recognize this place?
That's right. You know very well?
What's that funny sound?
Did you just fart?
That's all Jamal's fault.
See you after class.
My back door needs to be fixed.
He's at the playground with his friends.
He wants to go to the playground.
Let's do it again, guys.
I think it would be a good idea for you to go to Boston with Tom.
How do you know it's a bad movie if you've never even seen it?
Tom died of emphysema.
I'm going home to bed.
Tom needs to do what Mary asked him to do.
How dangerous was that?
Tom got married three days ago.
This next song is one that people always ask me to sing.
I didn't know that Tom was the one who was going to sing tonight.
How would you feel if someone hacked into your email account?
You keep telling me that I can't do anything.
Let's go to the garage and see if Jamal is there.
He will continue to cry if we stay here.
Do you wanna go see them by yourself?
Let's get out of this playground.
Jamal feels a little better.
I know this place.
I'll show you. Watch.
Let's go to the garage and see if Tom is there.
Let's go visit Tom.
Let's go visit Tom in Boston.
Let's go see if Tom is at home.
We went to Tom's house to talk to him, but he wasn't at home.
Tom is likely to do that.
I'm not ready to stop.
Tom may not have done what he said he did.
How did you get so fat?
Tom got out of jail in October.
It'll be difficult for me to sing this song in that key.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
How much fuel does a Boeing 747 carry for a nine-hour flight?
Tom swam with his son.
I'm really scared now.
So where's the fire?
We have had so much fun.
I wanna be a smart man like Jamal when I grow up?
The electric car suddenly ran out of energy.
I know a filling station not very far from here.
My engine is gonna go off soon.
OK. Just a little more.
We safely arrived at the hospital.
You do seem very close.
You're very good together.
Have you finished filling?
Jamal came back in the evening.
Can you come down slowly?
I can move freely now.
You must be so tired.
I know it must be hard.
Jamal has to go home now.
You're wasting your time with me.
Aren't you tired from taking care of him all day?
Why did they become so close?
I had so much fun.
I had a lot of fun, too.
Our bond of friendship is stronger for ever.
Stop right now!
Didn't I tell you it's dangerous to speed on the road?
This is the last time I let you go.
You're stopping on the stop line.
You have to follow the rules for your own safety.
It might seem like a minor rule, but you have to keep to it next time.
You shouldn't let him go that easily.
Am I right this time?
You must pay attention to the road when you're driving.
Stop the bus exactly at the station.
Let's go and play with the ball.
Don't you know it's dangerous to play with a ball by the roadside?
You must have been scared.
You really didn't have to be so hard on the kids.
You could still do that in a nicer way.
I didn't do anything wrong, man.
I wish Fadil could be a little more nice.
It'd be good if you came alone?
So what was that about?
How do you feel about acting a little nicer?
Are you behaving yourselves today?
You can go now, I guess.
Fadil seems to be in a good mood today.
Tom may not do what we've asked him to do.
How tough was the test?
Tom got to school just in time.
Is there anything else you would like me to buy for you?
Tom couldn't have finished writing the report without your help.
How long has it been since you've slept in a comfortable bed?
We can't let Tom sing.
I've run out of ideas.
Tom agreed to take the job we offered him.
How come you don't sing?
Something was tickling me all of a sudden.
I stopped behind the stop line correctly this time.
Tom had dinner with the others.
Do you think you can write that report without any help?
How can anyone trust anything Tom says? He's a pathological liar.
How were you able to stay so calm in such a scary situation?
I couldn't go anywhere.
It's because of me that Tom is doing that.
How did it go yesterday?
Tom had his left leg amputated.
You go first, Jamal.
We'll go first.
Jamal kept bursting out with laughter.
Fadil seems to be in a really good mood.
Maybe we should go to the repair shop.
Are you lost by any chance?
I'll take you to the kindergarten.
I don't wanna get on.
You're making me laugh.
How did you know that Tom was the one who made these sandwiches?
How much do you pay each year for your children's education?
Tom may have done that.
I have to do that soon.
It wasn't easy to convince Tom to help us.
How did the fight begin?
Tom had to do different things.
You didn't have to sing with us if you didn't want to.
How long do you think Tom and Mary have been seeing each other?
How could anyone in their right mind do something like that?
See? It isn't scary, right?
Jamal is here.
That's our job. That's what we're here for.
What's tickling me?
I have to go to the repair shop tomorrow.
You seem to be in a good mood today.
Fadil seems to be in a really good mood today.
It must be hard for you, I know.
Jamal brought his car to the repair shop to have it checked.
I wonder what's wrong, Jamal.
It tickles.
Take a look at these feathers.
No one is gonna take me seriously now.
Go out on the road and you'll see.
Everybody seems to like Jamal.
Doesn't the city seem safer now?
Can you actually come with Jamal?
What was the call about?
There will be a safety lesson at the kindergarten.
They were playing together at the playground.
We've really had a good match.
Where is he rushing to?
I'm already late for school.
They just went past us.
Haven't I told you it's dangerous to speed in this area?
At least we're not late.
We will learn a new song today.
It's not time to fool around.
Very well done, Jamal.
They felt good to be praised.
I think we suit each other very well.
How didn't we figure this out earlier.
We can go some other time.
That doesn't seem right at all.
Follow me carefully.
Yellow is my favorite color.
Since that day, they have become very close.
What color do we blend with blue to get green?
Shall we go now, guys?
I can have so much fun just playing by myself.
It's quite tiring doing it all alone.
Where are they flying those kites from?
Can you make me a cup of tea?
Do you wanna come to the riverside with me tomorrow?
You'll like it very much.
I've got great news for you, Fadil.
Jamal has got the tickets.
Fadil must have forgotten his promise to Layla.
Jamal is waiting for Sarah.
I've never gone on a ferry before.
So shall we go now?
Jamal is late again.
When are you coming?
It's all thanks to Jamal.
Our friends are the best.
Why isn't Jamal coming?
Why isn't Jamal coming tonight?
So you wanna do this?
I found something very interesting.
Jamal waited for you all afternoon.
Am I too late, guys?
Where have you been, Jamal?
You didn't leave yet.
I forgot about our plan for today.
Aren't you angry?
So how did you find them?
I guess we are meant to be best friends.
I think it's more fun to play with you.
Let's play together next time.
If I'm elected mayor, I'll make the town great again.
He immediately fell asleep.
As a mayor, I've brought prosperity to our village.
Are you that lost?
By now, he must be starving.
I don't really feel like it.
So you really wanna get rid of me.
A walk after eating is good for health.
A walk after eating is good for digestion.
I know you have a girlfriend. Don't lie to me.
I have started dreaming about you from the moment I set my eyes on you.
You did that to Jamal?
She's married to Jamal.
I don't trust that woman at all.
Sooner or later, she'll betray Jamal.
She's with Jamal.
Jamal adores her.
Jamal would die for her.
Has Jamal been around?
Where did Jamal go?
I give sensational massages.
You'll become totally addicted to my massages.
Do you like watching porn movies?
Do you like visiting porn websites?
Marriage and relationships are slavery.
It's me, Jamal. Call me back.
I haven't been able to reach you all morning. Where are you?
If you don't grab the opportunity, you'll lose it.
Here's the room key.
What are you waiting for? Let's go.
There is not much to say about me.
That's how I live.
I'm studying and also working.
I don't have time to waste, guys.
I was a baby then.
You refuse to give anyone else a chance.
I don't have plans for my immediate future.
You can absolutely do everything you just told me.
I'm a little too young.
Did you manage to call Jamal?
It's unusual for Jamal to go missing without saying anything.
I could eat an elephant.
I hope you'll like them.
I hope you enjoy it.
The important thing is you're here.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
I'll never let you go.
I don't know what you're planning to do, but I won't let you do it.
Credit card or cash?
I really need those diapers now.
This is all I have. Take it.
You have to pay the amount shown on the cash register.
You have to understand that I have to go now.
We don't have the right to do this.
Is there a problem, Sir?
I really can't help you.
The diapers are for my twins.
You don't have to push me.
I didn't think it was the moment.
Tom played lead guitar.
I know I'm not perfect.
It was clear that Tom didn't want to sing.
How did you get so rich?
Tom had to learn to talk again.
What's the real reason you don't want to go to Boston?
How can I explain this in a way that even Tom would understand?
How can we prevent something like this from happening again?
Tom tried not to cough.
I said the wrong thing.
Has Tom been around?
Tom immediately fell asleep.
Tom must've forgotten his promise to Mary.
Tom must've forgotten what he promised Mary.
Tom must've forgotten what he promised to do for Mary.
Everybody seems to like Tom.
It looks like Tom doesn't know how to ski.
How do I know it's safe?
Tom had to turn down the offer.
It would take at least three hours to paint this room.
Tom thought it would be safe for Mary to walk home by herself.
How young were you when you first started singing on stage?
We'll help Tom do that.
I used to hate spinach.
Is Tom the one who taught you how to sing?
How do you like my gown?
Tom's girlfriend is Canadian.
There was no way I could not have asked Tom that question.
I just had to ask Tom that question.
Stay curious.
I know you and you're nothing.
We had to go back to the drawing board.
You can touch it, if you like.
You can touch it if you want.
Babylon was famous for its hanging gardens.
What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one.
The orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of bees.
Thomas Lynde - a meek little man whom Avonlea people called "Rachel Lynde's husband" - was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn.
Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there?
He wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea.
He was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk.
I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he's gone and why.
I'm leading a country.
It's no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd, living away back here by themselves.
Trees aren't much company, though dear knows if they were there'd be enough of them.
A body can get used to anything, even to being hanged, as the Irishman said.
Not a stray stick nor stone was to be seen, for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been.
Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously.
There were three plates laid, so that Marilla must be expecting someone home with Matthew to tea.
This is a real fine evening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?
Something that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel, in spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.
Marilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it.
She had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.
Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight.
If Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.
"Are you in earnest, Marilla?" she demanded when voice returned to her.
"What on earth put such a notion into your head?" she demanded disapprovingly.
What on earth put such a notion into your head?
This had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be disapproved.
Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before Christmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the asylum over in Hopeton in the spring.
Matthew is getting up in years, you know - he's sixty - and he isn't so spry as he once was.
We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer today—the mail-man brought it from the station—saying they were coming on the five-thirty train tonight.
Mrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind.
Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a mighty foolish thing - a risky thing, that's what.
If you had asked my advice in the matter - which you didn't do, Marilla - I'd have said for mercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what.
"Well, I hope it will turn out all right," said Mrs. Rachel in a tone that plainly indicated her painful doubts.
Matthew and Marilla don't know anything about children.
The air was sweet with the breath of many apple orchards.
The meadows sloped away in the distance to horizon mists of pearl and purple.
The little birds sang as if it were the one day of summer in all the year.
Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him.
He had looked at twenty very much as he looked at sixty, lacking a little of the grayness.
The long platform was almost deserted; the only living creature in sight being a girl who was sitting on a pile of shingles at the extreme end.
There was a passenger dropped off for you—a little girl. She's sitting out there on the shingles.
I asked her to go into the ladies' waiting room, but she informed me gravely that she preferred to stay outside.
She wore a faded brown sailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids of very thick, decidedly red hair.
Her face was small, white and thin, also much freckled.
Her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which looked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.
I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?
I'm very glad to see you. I was beginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining all the things that might have happened to prevent you.
I had made up my mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to that big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all night.
It would be lovely to sleep in a wild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think?
"I'm sorry I was late," he said shyly.
Come along. The horse is over in the yard. Give me your bag.
I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you can't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you could imagine.
I don't ever expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to marry me.
I just love pretty clothes.
I've never had a pretty dress in my life that I can remember.
This morning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear this horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you know.
Am I talking too much? People are always telling me I do.
Like most quiet folks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking themselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it.
Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.
Is there a brook anywhere near Green Gables?
It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook.
Dreams don't often come true, do they? Wouldn't it be nice if they did?
You can't always please everyone.
He gave me a pencil.
How do you start your Monday?
Tom handed me a sheet of paper.
You should seriously consider not doing that anymore.
I'm still waiting for Tom to pay me back the money I lent him.
How was I supposed to know we weren't allowed in that room?
I wish I could help Tom.
I'm interested in that.
I'm sure Tom won't want to sing that song.
How else can we do this?
Tom has a crush on his teacher.
You have to do this. You don't have any other choice.
Tom doesn't think that Mary was the one who stole his bicycle.
How did you like the restaurant that you ate at last night?
I'm glad I was with Tom.
I'm looking for my dog.
I know Tom is going to want to go with us.
How fast can you car go?
Tom has a lot of acquaintances.
We need to learn not to take ourselves too seriously.
I don't see why Tom wouldn't want to go to the dance with you.
How long has it been since you've had a good night's sleep?
Let Tom sing by himself.
I'm not ready to leave.
I hope Tom did what he was supposed to do.
How often do you use it?
Tom has a lot of history books.
It's not uncommon to see Americans kissing in public.
How did you know that Tom's passport was in the bottom drawer?
How could you do such a terrible thing to your own brother?
Tom is afraid of ghosts.
I'm willing to do that.
Tom and Mary don't know anything about children.
Tom and Mary are bad parents.
Tom and Mary are good parents.
What time do we start in the morning?
She was divinely beautiful.
Which would you rather be if you had the choice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?
I've never had a real home since I can remember.
Oh, isn't that pretty!
Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a white-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection.
From the marsh at the head of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.
There was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on a slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was shining from one of its windows.
"That's Barry's pond," said Matthew.
Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it - let me see - the Lake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it.
To the west a dark church spire rose up against a marigold sky.
Below was a little valley and beyond a long, gently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it.
In the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining like a lamp of guidance and promise.
Oh, it seems as if I must be in a dream.
The yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves were rustling silkily all round it.
"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep," she whispered, as he lifted her to the ground. "What nice dreams they must have!"
Anne is a real good plain sensible name. You've no need to be ashamed of it.
We want a boy to help Matthew on the farm. A girl would be of no use to us.
Matthew Cuthbert, you don't mean to say you think we ought to keep her!
Marilla's astonishment could not have been greater if Matthew had expressed a predilection for standing on his head.
"What good would she be to us?" "We might be some good to her," said Matthew suddenly and unexpectedly.
There's something I don't understand about her.
It was broad daylight when Anne awoke and sat up in bed, staring confusedly at the window through which a flood of cheery sunshine was pouring.
For a moment she could not remember where she was.
A huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against the house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf was to be seen.
On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of apple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms; and their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions.
In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind.
Below the garden, a green field lush with clover sloped down to the hollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew.
She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child; but this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.
Why can't you do that?
I don't think I can stop Tom from leaving.
How bad a driver are you?
Tom has a very expensive watch.
Do you know anyone who might want be able to help us?
How could you not know what was going on between Tom and Mary?
How many people do you think will be at tonight's concert?
Tom is now my assistant.
I've always lived here.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary so much.
How bad is your headache?
Marilla really did not know how to talk to the child, and her uncomfortable ignorance made her crisp and curt when she did not mean to be.
It's a big tree.
Oh, isn't it wonderful?
I'm so glad there's a brook near Green Gables.
The worst of imagining things is that the time comes when you have to stop and that hurts.
You'd better get dressed and come downstairs.
Breakfast is waiting.
Wash your face and comb your hair.
I'm pretty hungry this morning.
I'm glad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear up under affliction on a sunshiny day.
"For pity's sake hold your tongue," said Marilla. "You talk entirely too much for a little girl."
She had an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might be there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy cloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination.
Who would want such a child about the place? Yet Matthew wished to keep her, of all unaccountable things!
When the meal was ended Anne came out of her reverie and offered to wash the dishes.
"Can you wash dishes right?" asked Marilla distrustfully.
I felt that he was a kindred spirit as soon as ever I saw him.
You're both queer enough, if that's what you mean by kindred spirits.
Yes, you may wash the dishes. Take plenty of hot water, and be sure you dry them well.
After you've finished the dishes go upstairs and make your bed.
"What's the matter now?" demanded Marilla.
There is no use in loving things if you have to be torn from them, is there?
What is the name of that geranium on the window sill?
I named that cherry-tree outside my bedroom window this morning. I called it Snow Queen because it was so white.
Anne had relapsed into reverie, with her chin in her hands and her eyes on the sky.
I'll take Anne with me and Mrs. Spencer will probably make arrangements to send her back to Nova Scotia at once.
I'll be home in time to milk the cows.
There is nothing more aggravating than a man who won't talk back - unless it is a woman who won't.
Oh, look, there's one little early wild rose out! Isn't it lovely?
Wouldn't it be nice if roses could talk? I'm sure they could tell us such lovely things.
Isn't pink the most bewitching color in the world? I love it, but I can't wear it. Redheaded people can't wear pink, not even in imagination.
Well, that is another hope gone. My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.
My life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.
That's a sentence I read in a book once, and I say it over to comfort myself whenever I'm disappointed in anything.
I am so fond of romantic things, and a graveyard full of buried hopes is about as romantic a thing as one can imagine isn't it?
I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.
My father's name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the Bolingbroke High School.
I'm so glad my parents had nice names. It would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah, wouldn't it?
I read in a book once that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been able to believe it.
I don't believe a rose would be as nice if it was called a thistle or a skunk cabbage.
My mother was a teacher in the High school, too, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A husband was enough responsibility.
They were as poor as church mice.
They went to live in a weeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke.
I've never seen that house, but I've imagined it thousands of times.
She died of fever when I was just three months old.
She had twins three times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in succession is too much.
Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for the child.
What a starved, unloved life she had had--a life of drudgery and poverty and neglect.
Isn't the sea wonderful?
That's the White Sands Hotel.
Down at the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy coves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels.
Beyond lay the sea, shimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions flashing silvery in the sunlight.
The shore road was woodsy and wild and lonesome.
Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express wagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away.
I enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the children all the time.
Mrs. Spencer lived in a big yellow house at White Sands Cove.
I promised Matthew I'd be home early.
Let me introduce you two ladies. Mrs. Blewett, Miss Cuthbert.
Anne, you sit here on the ottoman and don't wiggle.
Let me take your hats.
Flora Jane, go out and put the kettle on.
Please excuse me for just a moment. I forgot to tell Flora Jane to take the buns out of the oven.
How old are you and what's your name?
Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.
Marilla looked at Anne and softened at the sight of the child's pale face with its look of mute misery--the misery of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which it had escaped.
Her eyes grew deep and bright as morning stars.
"I'd rather go back to the asylum than go to live with her," said Anne passionately.
Go back and sit down quietly and hold your tongue and behave as a good girl should.
Matthew's shy face was a glow of delight.
Tom forgot to tell Mary to take the bread out of the oven.
I noticed last night that you threw your clothes all about the floor when you took them off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can't allow it at all.
As soon as you take off any article of clothing fold it neatly and place it on the chair.
Say your prayers now and get into bed.
Tom has always been a musician.
You still haven't done what you were supposed to do.
Tom has been told several times not to sing so late at night.
How difficult was it for you to find a job here in Boston?
Tom said it was a prank.
I don't think it's cold.
How does Tom handle situations like these?
How can I find the truth?
Tom has been arguing with Mary.
You should seriously consider applying for that job.
Do you have any idea who might want be able to help us?
Tom didn't seem to be having any trouble convincing Mary to go out with him.
How confident are you that they will get these repairs completed by Monday?
Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?
God always wants little girls to say their prayers.
Why must people kneel down to pray? If I really wanted to pray I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd go out into a great big field all alone or into the deep, deep, woods, and I'd look up into the sky--up--up--up--into that lovely blue sky that looks as if there was no end to its blueness. And then I'd just feel a prayer.
Let me take your coats.
My mother died when I was just three months old.
Her most serious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in the middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was sharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.
Matthew and I have decided to keep you — that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself grateful.
Why, child, whatever is the matter?
"I'm crying," said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. "I can't think why. I'm glad as glad can be."
"Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?" asked Anne wide-eyed. "No."
When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances He doesn't mean for us to imagine them away.
I thought you said we weren't going to go to Boston with Tom.
How can I lower my high blood pressure without medication?
Tom told me not to sing.
I love playing football.
How do you know Tom won't want to do that?
How can it get any worse?
Tom has done that a lot lately.
Would you like to join me and my friend for a drink?
I think it's pretty obvious that Tom doesn't want to do that.
How long is it going to be before the heat comes back on?
Tom told us not to sing.
I really enjoy swimming.
How do we know that Tom wrote this letter?
How could it be my fault?
Tom has dozens of French books.
Why would you want to go there if you don't have to?
I think asking Tom to be your partner would be a big mistake.
How much more money would it cost to buy the larger size?
Tom hired Mary to help.
I still have to do that.
How did Tom know you could play the piano?
How did we get this deal?
Tom has enough money to buy it.
We have to deal with that before the end of the day.
I think it's pretty obvious that Tom doesn't want to be here.
How would you like it if I gossiped about your children?
Why isn't Tom resigning?
I'm thrilled to be here.
How did Tom know that was going to happen?
How did you get that job?
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
I promised Tom I'd be home by 2:30.
I promised Tom I wouldn't do that.
I told Tom I'd be home this evening.
Tom has good chance of winning.
We have no choice but to do what they told us to do.
I realized later that the person I was talking to wasn't Tom.
How could you do something like that to your own brother?
Why was Tom there alone?
I cried when my dog died.
How could Tom not know what the rules are?
How did you get the idea?
Tom has had plenty of practice.
We aren't rich enough to buy a house on Park Street.
How could I have known Tom would get so upset by my comments?
How much time did it take you to come up with this plan?
How did Tom get up there?
I don't want to eat that.
How can Tom possibly do what you're doing?
How do we deal with that?
Tom has helped me in many ways.
They don't realize that we know they're lying to us.
Tom said that he had expected something different to happen.
How much time does it take to master a foreign language?
I bet Tom could help you.
I just want you to leave.
Do you know all of Tom's children's names?
How do you like my dress?
Tom has just bought a used car.
It would take at least three hours to get this done.
Should we tell Tom he doesn't need to be at today's meeting?
I didn't ask Tom to sing.
I know I can do this job.
If I wasn't a human girl I think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers.
"If I wasn't a human girl I think I'd like to be a bee and live among the flowers." "Yesterday you wanted to be a sea gull," sniffed Marilla. "I think you are very fickle minded."
Come here, child, and let me have a look at you.
