Punctuation helps to show grammatical relationships and, at least in English, is also used to indicate intonation.
Just act like nothing happened.

The Canadian government’s guide to writing says that the role of punctuation is to clarify, and "this principle takes precedence over all precepts governing the use of individual marks of punctuation."

Robots are smarter than humans anyway.
According to the Canadian government "punctuation should be as consistent as possible within a given text". That would mean that one and the same writer may use a different style of punctuation in a different text on another occasion.
There are many ways to do this.

"Kindness can bring even bigger trouble. With kindness, comes naivété. Courage becomes foolhardiness. And dedication has no reward. If you can't accept any of that, you are not fit to be in this business."
It's so racist.

She's so racist.
You drank too little.

Does it get any better than this?
I will try to make it at home.
I don't regret it at all.
If Tom had made that investment, he'd be a billionaire today.
He can't afford to retire.
Some bolts need to be tightened up.
He walked out the door and never came back.
Small children work as slaves on the chocolate plantation.
Are you serious about that question?
The resemblance between these two men is uncanny.
Is there anything else I need to know?
Tom is tall and thin.
This tall and thin young man had a spontaneous pneumothorax.
This doesn't seem normal.
Tom suffered from a collapsed lung.
The knife punctured his lung.
My worst fears came true.
It wasn't always this way.
Pinocchio's legs were so stiff that he could not move them.
Catch him! Catch him!
Catch her! Catch her!
The Carabineer grabbed him by the nose (it was an extremely long one and seemed made on purpose for that very thing) and returned him to Mastro Geppetto.
The little old man wanted to pull Pinocchio's ears. Think how he felt when, upon searching for them, he discovered that he had forgotten to make them!
His happiness lasted only a short time.
Pinocchio turned and saw a large cricket crawling slowly up the wall.
I am the Talking Cricket and I have been living in this room for more than one hundred years.
Woe to boys who refuse to obey their parents and run away from home! They will never be happy in this world, and when they are older they will be very sorry for it.
If I stay here the same thing will happen to me which happens to all other boys and girls. They are sent to school, and whether they want to or not, they must study. As for me, let me tell you, I hate to study! It's much more fun, I think, to chase after butterflies, climb trees, and steal birds' nests.
If you do not like going to school, why don't you at least learn a trade, so that you can earn an honest living?
"Of all the trades in the world, there is only one that really suits me." "And what can that be?" "That of eating, drinking, sleeping, playing, and wandering around from morning till night."
Careful, ugly Cricket! If you make me angry, you'll be sorry!
"Poor Pinocchio, I am sorry for you." "Why?" "Because you are a marionette and, what is much worse, you have a wooden head."
At these last words, Pinocchio jumped up in a fury, took a hammer from the bench, and threw it with all his strength at the Talking Cricket.
With a last weak "cri-cri-cri" the poor Cricket fell from the wall, dead!
I have never seen anything quite like this.
France, Austria and Russia formed an alliance against Prussia.
What's the difference between a star and a planet?
He was surprised by what he found.
Mary was a good-hearted girl who helped wherever she could.
His books have been translated into several languages.
Stars undergo nuclear reactions that burn hydrogen in their cores.
But Tom had one final trick up his sleeve.
That would be so funny.
What is Freedom Flotilla?
Do you wear shoes indoors?
Do you wear shoes inside your house?
Why would anyone think that was a good idea?
That's just an old wives' tale.
I'm glad it works for you.
Tom works on a sheep farm.
I'm in the post office.
"Where's the water?" "It evaporated."
Tom devoted his life to finding a solution to the problem.
I drink water.
That sounds like a fun job.
Peter the Cruel is also known as Peter the Just.
He's tall and muscular.
He's a star in Germany, but completely unknown in America.
He married her in secret.
A brown dwarf is a celestial object, in which fusion occurs, but that is not massive enough to fuse hydrogen.
She bore him four children.
She has a fake tan.
She's just so fake.
That is why she didn't want to be with him any more.
Do you find it easy to deal with the people you meet in the course of your work?
How cold is Canada?
Canada is a very cold country.
Everybody hates them.
Everybody hates him.
Everybody hates her.
This is a step in the right direction.
Tom is a zookeeper.
Tom is a seaman.
Tom stole his dad's credit card.
Tom is a frequent flyer.
A boy's appetite grows very fast.
He was as ravenous as a bear.
His long nose became at least two inches longer.
The Talking Cricket was right. It was wrong of me to disobey Father and to run away from home. If he were here now, I wouldn't be so hungry! Oh, how horrible it is to be hungry!
The night was pitch black.
It thundered, and bright flashes of lightning now and again shot across the sky, turning it into a sea of fire.
An angry wind blew cold and raised dense clouds of dust, while the trees shook and moaned in a weird way.
Pinocchio was greatly afraid of thunder and lightning, but the hunger he felt was far greater than his fear.
The whole village was dark and deserted. The stores were closed, the doors, the windows. In the streets, not even a dog could be seen. It seemed the Village of the Dead.
An old man in a nightcap opened the window and looked out. He called down angrily: "What do you want at this hour of night?"
There he fell asleep, and while he slept, his wooden feet began to burn. Slowly, very slowly, they blackened and turned to ashes.
Is Tom a member of the Royal Family?
"Open! I say," repeated Geppetto, "or I'll give you a sound whipping when I get in."
My little Pinocchio, my dear little Pinocchio! How did you burn your feet?
Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.
I never liked school.
I should never have thought, dear boy of mine, that you were so dainty and fussy about your food. Bad, very bad! In this world, even as children, we must accustom ourselves to eat of everything, for we never know what life may hold in store for us!
I will not eat the pears if they are not peeled. I don't like them.
"I promise you," answered the marionette, sobbing, "that from now on I'll be good—"
Boys always promise that when they want something.
I promise to go to school every day, to study, and to succeed.
But I am not like other boys! I am better than all of them and I always tell the truth. I promise you, Father, that I'll learn a trade, and I'll be the comfort and staff of your old age.
It's the deadliest city in America.
Close your eyes and sleep!
Pinocchio closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep.
Geppetto did not have a penny in his pocket, so he made his son a little suit of flowered paper, a pair of shoes from the bark of a tree, and a tiny cap from a bit of dough.
What's wrong with these people?
What's the difference between a religion and a cult?
Pinocchio ran to look at himself in a bowl of water, and he felt so happy that he said proudly: "Now I look like a gentleman."
When poverty shows itself, even mischievous boys understand what it means.
"Where's your coat, Father?" "I have sold it." "Why did you sell your coat?" "It was too warm."
Pinocchio understood the answer and, unable to restrain his tears, he jumped on his father's neck and kissed him over and over.
As he walked along, his brain was busy planning hundreds of wonderful things, building hundreds of castles in the air.
Guess what I did last night.
Fathers are indeed good to their children!
Tomorrow I'll go to school. There's always plenty of time to go to school.
"What is that house?" Pinocchio asked a little boy near him. "Read the sign and you'll know." "I'd like to read, but somehow I can't today."
"I'll give you four pennies for your A-B-C book," said a ragpicker who stood by.
The curtain was up and the performance had started.
His beard was as black as pitch, and so long that it reached from his chin down to his feet.
His mouth was as wide as an oven, his teeth like yellow fangs, and his eyes, two glowing red coals.
In his huge, hairy hands, a long whip, made of green snakes and black cats' tails twisted together, swished through the air in a dangerous way.
Enough! Be quiet! I'll take care of you later.
As soon as the play was over, the Director went to the kitchen, where a fine big lamb was slowly turning on the spit. More wood was needed to finish cooking it.
Father, save me! I don't want to die! I don't want to die!
Fire Eater (this was really his name) was very ugly.
There is no mercy here, Pinocchio. I have spared you. Harlequin must burn in your place. I am hungry and my dinner must be cooked.
He had gone barely half a mile when he met a lame Fox and a blind Cat, walking together like two good friends. The lame Fox leaned on the Cat, and the blind Cat let the Fox lead him along.
"You, a rich man?" said the Fox, and he began to laugh out loud. The Cat was laughing also, but tried to hide it by stroking his long whiskers.
I want to go to school and study hard.
"Look at me," said the Fox. "For the silly reason of wanting to study, I have lost a paw." "Look at me," said the Cat. "For the same foolish reason, I have lost the sight of both eyes."
In the twinkling of an eyelid, the Cat leaped on the blackbird, and ate him, feathers and all.
"Poor blackbird!" said Pinocchio to the Cat. "Why did you kill him?"
I killed him to teach him a lesson. He talks too much. Next time he will keep his words to himself.
"Do you want to double your gold pieces?" "What do you mean?"
Instead of returning home, come with us.
Home is near, and I'm going where Father is waiting for me. How unhappy he must be that I have not yet returned! I have been a bad son, and the Talking Cricket was right when he said that a disobedient boy cannot be happy in this world.
Just outside the City of Simple Simons, there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders.
Just outside the City of Catchfools, there is a blessed field called the Field of Wonders.
In this field you dig a hole and in the hole you bury a gold piece. After covering up the hole with earth you water it well, sprinkle a bit of salt on it, and go to bed. During the night, the gold piece sprouts, grows, blossoms, and next morning you find a beautiful tree, that is loaded with gold pieces.
"We do not work for gain," answered the Fox. "We work only to enrich others."
"What good people," thought Pinocchio to himself. And forgetting his father, the new coat, the A-B-C book, and all his good resolutions, he said to the Fox and to the Cat: "Let us go. I am with you."
"Let us stop here a while," said the Fox, "to eat a bite and rest for a few hours."
As soon as Pinocchio was in bed, he fell fast asleep and began to dream.
As he walked, Pinocchio noticed a tiny insect glimmering on the trunk of a tree, a small being that glowed with a pale, soft light.
"Who are you?" he asked. "I am the ghost of the Talking Cricket," answered the little being in a faint voice that sounded as if it came from a far-away world.
Return home and give the four gold pieces you have left to your poor old father who is weeping because he has not seen you for many a day.
Don't listen to those who promise you wealth overnight, my boy. As a rule they are either fools or swindlers! Listen to me and go home.
Remember that boys who insist on having their own way, sooner or later come to grief.
Once again the road was plunged in darkness.
I think assassins have been invented by fathers and mothers to frighten children who want to run away at night.
Your money or your life!
And after having killed you, we will kill your father also.
No, no, no, not my Father!
Quick as a flash, the marionette sank his teeth deep into the Assassin's hand, bit it off and spat it out.
His pursuers were after him at once, like two dogs chasing a hare.
At the noise, a window opened and a lovely maiden looked out.
She had azure hair and a face white as wax. Her eyes were closed and her hands crossed on her breast.
No one lives in this house. Everyone is dead.
"I also am dead." "Dead? What are you doing at the window, then?"
Pinocchio was made of very hard wood and the knives broke into a thousand pieces.
They tied Pinocchio's hands behind his shoulders and slipped the noose around his neck.
These were his last words. He closed his eyes, opened his mouth, stretched out his legs, and hung there, as if he were dead.
The word lends itself to misuse by beginners.
Tom rejects modern technology and lives like in the eighties.
The lovely maiden with azure hair was none other than a very kind fairy who had lived, for more than a thousand years, in the vicinity of the forest.
To my mind this marionette is dead and gone; but if, by any evil chance, he were not, then that would be a sure sign that he is still alive!
I am sorry," said the Owl, "to have to contradict the Crow, my famous friend and colleague. To my mind this Marionette is alive; but if, by any evil chance, he were not, then that would be a sure sign that he is wholly dead!"
I say that a wise doctor, when he does not know what he is talking about, should know enough to keep his mouth shut.
He is rude, lazy, a runaway.
Pinocchio hid his face under the sheets.
That Marionette is a disobedient son who is breaking his father's heart!
"When the dead weep, they are beginning to recover," said the Crow solemnly.
"I am sorry to contradict my famous friend and colleague," said the Owl, "but as far as I'm concerned, I think that when the dead weep, it means they do not want to die."
As soon as the three doctors had left the room, the Fairy went to Pinocchio's bed and, touching him on the forehead, noticed that he was burning with fever.
Drink this, and in a few days you'll be up and well.
"If it's bitter, I don't want it." "Drink it!" "I don't like anything bitter."
"Do you promise?" "Yes."
I won't drink this awful water. I won't. I won't! No, no, no, no!
"Aren't you afraid of death?" "Not a bit. I'd rather die than drink that awful medicine."
Give me that glass! Quick, please! I don't want to die!
As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became at least two inches longer.
At this second lie, his nose grew a few more inches.
It's the best feeling.
Tom is a limo driver.
At this third lie, his nose became longer than ever, so long that he could not even turn around.
"Why do you laugh?" "I am laughing at your lies." "How do you know I'm lying?"
There are two kinds of lies, lies with short legs and lies with long noses. Yours, just now, happen to have long noses.
Crying as if his heart would break, the Marionette mourned for hours over the length of his nose.
The Fairy showed no pity toward him, as she was trying to teach him a good lesson, so that he would stop telling lies, the worst habit any boy may acquire.
A thousand woodpeckers flew in through the window and settled themselves on Pinocchio's nose. They pecked and pecked so hard at that enormous nose that in a few moments, it was the same size as before.
"I love you, too," answered the Fairy, "and if you wish to stay with me, you may be my little brother and I'll be your good little sister."
What an awful world to live in!
What an awful world we live in!
Then he ended by doing what all boys do, when they have no heart and little brain.
Dig a hole here and put the gold pieces into it.
I don't wanna hear another word about it.
I'll build myself a beautiful palace, with a thousand stables filled with a thousand wooden horses to play with, a cellar overflowing with lemonade and ice cream soda, and a library of candies and fruits, cakes and cookies.
More than 500 baby sea turtles were released into the sea.
In the German Wikipedia there are people who are such sticklers for rules, that other contributors, often far more knowledgeable, take to their heels en masse.
The judge listened to him with great patience. A kind look shone in his eyes. He became very much interested in the story; he felt moved; he almost wept.
This poor simpleton has been robbed of four gold pieces. Take him, therefore, and throw him into prison.
It had rained for many days, and the road was so muddy that, at times, Pinocchio sank down almost to his knees.
I'm sad now.
I am certainly very stubborn and stupid!
From now on, I'll be different and I'll try to become a most obedient boy.
Hunger, my boy, is no reason for taking something which belongs to another.
"It's true, it's true!" cried Pinocchio in tears. "I won't do it again."
"Ah, you little thief!" said the Farmer in an angry voice. "So you are the one who steals my chickens!"
I'll give you a lesson that you'll remember for a long while.
I'll give you a lesson that you'll remember for a long time.
I like him, but I'm too shy to talk to him.
Even though a boy may be very unhappy, he very seldom loses sleep over his worries.
There's no going back.
The farmer heard the loud barks and jumped out of bed. Taking his gun, he leaped to the window and shouted: "What's the matter?"
The dead are gone and they cannot defend themselves. The best thing to do is to leave them in peace!
The little house was no longer there.
I could barely speak.
He could barely speak.
What are you guys doing?
Poor Pinocchio! He even tried to tear his hair, but as it was only painted on his wooden head, he could not even pull it.
"Tell me, little boy, what are you doing there?" "Can't you see? I'm crying."
The pigeon flew swiftly down to the earth. He was much larger than a turkey.
Oh, dear pigeon, how I wish I had your wings!
If you want to come, I'll take you with me.
The little boat, tossed about by the angry waters, appeared and disappeared in the waves.
Suddenly a huge wave came and the boat disappeared.
I'll save him! I'll save my father!
It poured rain, it hailed, it thundered, and the lightning was so bright that it turned the night into day.
He's always nice to everyone.
She confessed to liking him.
That was an interesting read.
Pinocchio tried his best to get there, but he couldn't.
Little by little the sky cleared. The sun came out in full splendor and the sea became as calm as a lake.
The marionette took off his clothes and laid them on the sand to dry.
He is the best father in the world, even as I am the worst son that can be found.
Pardon the bother, and many thanks for your kindness.
This is no place for me! I was not born for work.
There were only two means left to him in order to get a bite to eat. He had either to work or to beg.
The work is too hard for me.
Hey boys, what's up?
Hey guys, what's up?
Hey girls, what's up?
I hate my friends!
I love my enemies.
How come this never happens to me?
Aren't you ashamed? Instead of being a beggar in the streets, why don't you look for work and earn your own bread?
I want it to be a surprise.
I would like to talk to you the day after tomorrow.
Under no circumstances will we take part in military actions.

Tom and John are both competent alchemists. Tom often shows himself to be the more skillful, but both experience explosions in the lab.

Completely different from Tom was his boyfriend John, who was amicable and philanthropic.

Many people use Anglicisms because they don't know how to rewrite them, since there are no alternatives in their own languages. Thus, we see it as our task to think of good alternatives, lovingly and imaginatively.

All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; only the dose permits something not to be poisonous.
Mathematics is the language of the universe.
How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality? Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things.
As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
It's almost like magic.

He is both tall and handsome.
The jug was very heavy.
His stomach seemed a bottomless pit.
"How did you know it was I?" she asked, laughing. "My love for you told me who you were."
I am so old, I could almost be your mother!
For a long time I have wanted a mother, just like other boys.
"But how did you grow so quickly?" "That's a secret!"
"Oh, I'm tired of always being a Marionette!" cried Pinocchio disgustedly. "It's about time for me to grow into a man as everyone else does."
Good boys are obedient.
Good boys love study and work.
Good boys always tell the truth.
Good boys go gladly to school.
There is always hope for boys with hearts such as yours, though they may often be very mischievous. This is the reason why I have come so far to look for you.
No one can find happiness without work. Woe betide the lazy fellow! Laziness is a serious illness and one must cure it immediately; yes, even from early childhood. If not, it will kill you in the end.
A man, whether rich or poor, should do something in this world.
These words touched Pinocchio's heart.
I want to become a boy, no matter how hard it is.
As the days passed into weeks, even the teacher praised him, for he saw him attentive, hard working, and wide awake, always the first to come in the morning, and the last to leave when school was over.
Pinocchio's only fault was that he had too many friends. Among these were many well-known rascals, who cared not a jot for study or for success.
Take care, Pinocchio! Those bad companions will sooner or later make you lose your love for study. Some day they will lead you astray.
"Have you heard the news?" "No!" "A shark as big as a mountain has been seen near the shore."
What do you care about school? You can go there tomorrow.
"And what will the teacher say?" "Let him talk. He is paid to grumble all day long."
Let's see who gets there first!
Poor boy! If he had only known then the dreadful things that were to happen to him on account of his disobedience!
There was no sign of a shark.
Hey there, boys! Where's that shark?
Pinocchio understood that the boys had played a trick on him.
The joke's on you.
Aren't you ashamed of being such a goody-goody, and of studying so hard? You never have a bit of enjoyment.
"What do you want me to do?" "Hate school and books and teachers, as we all do. They are your worst enemies, you know, and they like to make you as unhappy as they can."
We are tired of hearing you bragging about yourself, you little turkey cock!
You may not be afraid of us, but remember we are not afraid of you, either!
"You are alone, you know, and we are seven." "Like the seven sins," said Pinocchio, still laughing.
Pinocchio, apologize for that, or look out!
We'll whip you soundly!
You'll go home with a broken nose!
Pinocchio, although alone, defended himself bravely.
Stop fighting, you rascals! These battles between boys rarely end well. Trouble is sure to come to you!
Among all his books, he liked that one the best.

"Tomorrow your wish will come true." "And what is it?" "Tomorrow you will cease to be a Marionette and will become a real boy."

In the Land of Toys, every day, except Sunday, is a Saturday. Vacation begins on the first of January and ends on the last day of December.
That is the place for me!
The wagon was drawn by twelve pair of donkeys, all of the same size, but all of different color.
The wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages that it looked like a box of sardines.
The thought that in a few hours they would reach a country where there were no schools, no books, no teachers, made these boys so happy that they felt neither hunger, nor thirst, nor sleep, nor discomfort.
Tell me, my fine boy, do you also want to come to my wonderful country?
I want to return home, as I prefer to study and to succeed in life.
The little fat man did not laugh.
This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world. Its population, large though it was, was composed wholly of boys. The oldest were about fourteen years of age, the youngest, eight.
Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together. Some played at marbles, at hopscotch, at ball. Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses.
His manly figure was adorned and enriched by a beautiful pair of donkey's ears.
He began to cry, to scream, to knock his head against the wall, but the more he shrieked, the longer and the more hairy grew his ears.
Within two or three hours you will become a real donkey, just like the ones that pull the fruit carts to market.
Oh, what have I done? What have I done?
Fate has decreed that all lazy boys who come to hate books and schools and teachers and spend all their days with toys and games must sooner or later turn into donkeys.
Tears now are useless. You should have thought of all this before.
"How are you?" "Very well. Like a mouse in a Parmesan cheese."
They laughed and laughed, and laughed again—laughed till they ached—laughed till they cried.
As they ran, their arms turned into legs, their faces lengthened into snouts and their backs became covered with long gray hairs.
The applause grew to a roar when Pinocchio, the famous donkey, appeared in the circus ring.
There, in front of him, in a box sat a beautiful woman. Around her neck she wore a long gold chain, from which hung a large medallion.
The next morning the veterinary—that is, the animal doctor—declared that he would be lame for the rest of his life.
His new owner took him to a high cliff overlooking the sea, put a stone around his neck, tied a rope to one of his hind feet, gave him a push, and threw him into the water.
I am going to take you to the market once more and sell you as dry firewood.
That sea monster was no other than the enormous shark, which has often been mentioned in this story and which, on account of its cruelty, had been nicknamed "The Attila of the Sea" by both fish and fishermen.
"But I don't want to be digested," shouted Pinocchio, starting to sob.
I am wise enough to think that if one is born a fish, it is more dignified to die under the water than in the frying pan.
"Are my eyes really telling me the truth?" answered the old man, rubbing his eyes. "Are you really my own dear Pinocchio?"
This candle you see here is the last one I have.
And in any case, if it is written that we must die, we shall at least die together.
Follow me and have no fear.

When bad boys become good and kind, they have the power of making their homes gay and new with happiness.

To show direction, the words take the accusative ending.
If a word in itself is "international", then according to rule 15 of our grammar we are entitled to use this word, even though it is not in the "Universala Vortaro".
The final vowel of a noun or of the definite article can be left out and replaced by an apostrophe.
So-called "foreign" words, i.e. those which the majority of languages have taken from one source, are used in Esperanto without modification, acquiring only Esperanto spelling; but when faced with a number of words derived from one root, it is better to leave only the fundamental word unmodified and from this create the derivatives according to the rules of Esperanto.
In lieu of the preposition "je" one can also use the accusative without a preposition.
In the presence of another negative word, the word "ne" is omitted.

How do you think Tom will do?
How do you think we're doing?
How do you think you did on the test?
How does that make sense?
How does Tom make a living?
How is Tom anyhow?
How long's that going to take?
How long's Tom been at your company?
How long's Tom had it?
How will it end?
How will they cope?
How will you escape?
How will you get away?
How will you get back?
How will you get home?
How would that help?
How would that look?
How would Tom know?
How would we do that?
How would you know that?
How would you react?
How you can be so blind?
How're you all doing today?
How's it going at school?
How's that going to help?
How's this going to end?
How's Tom going to do it?
I couldn't take that chance.
I don't have a middle name.
I expect Tom will be back soon.
I expect Tom won't want to do that.
I figured that would be your answer.
I have a whole list of people to call.
I have no choice but to accept your proposals.
I have no idea how this works.
I haven't seen Tom in weeks.
I knew exactly what Tom meant.
I know exactly how much it means to you.
I know exactly what it means.
I know exactly what Tom means.
I know how much it means to you.
I need to go pick up some supplies.
I need to know exactly what happened here yesterday.
I need to know exactly what happened to Tom.
I think we have time for a drink or two.
I thought this would make you happy.
I told you that would work.
I usually try to eat a healthy lunch.
I was thinking about going to Boston next month.
I'll get there somehow.
I'm in the middle of a meeting. Could I call you back later?
I've already seen one.
I've been there myself.
I've got a better one.
If this problem weren't serious, Tom wouldn't be here.
If Tom didn't think we needed help, he wouldn't be here.
If Tom doesn't do it, who will?
If we do that, everything's going to be all right.
If you were Tom, what would you do?
If you were Tom, what would you want?
If you were Tom, which would you choose?
If you wish, I'll ask.
In time, you will understand.
Is it all there?
Is it going to be bad?
Is it going to happen?
Is it time to eat?
Is it time to go?
Is it time to leave?
Is my time up?
Is that about right?
Is that all clear?
Is that all it is?
Is that all it says?
Is that all it takes?
Is that all it would take?
Is that all of them?
Is that all there is?
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all you've got?
Is that going to be awkward?
Is that going to be OK?
Is that one of ours?
Is that so complicated?
Is that so strange?
Is that so surprising?
Is that so unreasonable?
Is that Tom's bedroom?
Is that what it takes?
Is that what people do?
Is that what this is all about?
Is that what Tom says?
Is that what you feel?
Is that what you said?
Is that what you think of me?
Is that what you think we should do?
Is that what you were thinking?
Is that what you would do?
Is there a connection?
Is there a message?
Is there a pattern?
Is there a reward?
Is there a treatment?
Is there any objection?
Is there room for one more?
Is there something else?
Is there something more?
Is there something that you want?
Is there somewhere we can go?
Is there somewhere we can talk?
Is there time now?
Is this about me?
Is this all of them?
Is this all there is?
Is this all they do?
Is this going to hurt?
Is this going to take a while?
Is this going to work?
Is this one of your creations?
Is this something special?
Is this the one you saw?
Is Tom about to sing?
Is Tom an eyewitness?
Is Tom going to be all right?
Is Tom going to be here?
Is Tom going to do it or not?
Is Tom good-looking?
Is Tom in the hospital?
Is Tom out of his mind?
Is Tom taking it easy?
Isn't it time for lunch?
Isn't it time for you to leave?
Isn't that what you said?
Isn't that what you think happened?
Isn't that what you would have done?
Isn't there something you could do?
It all makes sense.
It can be repaired.
It does make a difference.
It doesn't have to make sense.
It goes on forever.
It isn't about that.
It isn't at all clear.
It made Tom bitter.
It made Tom happy.
It made Tom sad.
It must've been someone else.
It takes time to get to know Tom.
It took us a while, but we finally finished the job.
It was about money.
It was all going so well.
It was all Tom's idea.
It was all your imagination.
It was going to be a surprise.
It was just one of those things.
It was one of those things.
It was so embarrassing.
It was so obvious.
It was so romantic.
It was something else.
It was there all the time.
It was there for the taking.
It was there yesterday.
It was time for a change.
It was Tom's wish.
It was you all along, wasn't it?
It wasn't about money.
It wasn't about that.
It wasn't made of wood.
It wasn't so difficult.
It wasn't there before.
It won't be possible.
It would be a mistake.
It would be confusing.
It would be dangerous.
It would be different.
It would be difficult.
It would be illogical.
It would be pointless.
It would be possible.
It would be romantic.
It would've been so easy.
It wouldn't be fair.
It wouldn't have mattered.
It'll be done.
It'll take about an hour.
It'll take some time.
It'll take us hours to finish this.
It'll take you days to finish this job.
It's a good one.
It's a real good one.
It's all been a waste.
It's all been written.
It's all for the best.
It's all going to be all right.
It's all going to be fine.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the report.
It's all in the room.
It's all in this file.
It's all so different.
It's all so hopeless.
It's all so senseless.
It's all that matters.
It's all Tom can do not to cry.
It's all we have.
It's all work-related.
It's all you can do for now.
It's been getting worse.
It's been going on for months.
It's been in there for a week.
It's been known to happen.
It's been one of those days.
It's been so long.
It's been there a while.
It's done all the time.
It's getting darker.
It's going to be amazing.
It's going to be beautiful.
It's going to be brutal.
It's going to be close.
It's going to be closed.
It's going to be easy.
It's going to be embarrassing.
It's going to be fine, you know.
It's going to be good.
It's going to be huge.
It's going to be OK.
It's going to be packed.
It's going to be painful.
It's going to be perfect.
It's going to be tight.
It's going to be weird.
It's going to collapse.
It's going to explode.
It's going to get worse.
It's going to take a while.
It's going to take about an hour.
It's going to take all day.
It's going to take some time.
It's got to be a mistake.
It's in there somewhere.
It's like one of those.
It's not about money.
It's not about that.
It's not about the money, is it?
It's not about them.
It's not all bad.
It's not all that great.
It's not all that ridiculous.
It's not easy, but we're going to do it anyway.
It's not going anywhere.
It's not going to be long.
It's not going to be that bad.
It's not going to be that easy.
It's not going to be the same.
It's not going to happen.
It's not going to take long.
It's not going to work, is it?
It's not going to work, you know.
It's not going to work.
It's not going well, is it?
It's not like everyone doesn't have one.
It's not so bad.
It's not so cheap.
It's not so easy.
It's not so good.
It's not so hard.
It's not so little.
It's not so unusual.
It's not something you forget.
It's not there anymore.
It's not there now.
It's not Tom Mary has been protecting.
It's not up to you.
It's not what we thought it was.
It's one of mine.
It's one of our rules.
It's out of my hands.
It's out of our hands.
It's right there on your desk.
It's somebody else's turn.
It's something I've considered.
It's somewhere in this room.
It's that time again.
It's the other one.
It's the same one.
It's time for a change.
It's time for action.
It's time for cake.
It's time for my break.
It's time for pizza.
It's time for you to go home.
It's time to decide.
It's time to get going.
It's time to get ready.
It's time to go now.
It's time to have some fun.
It's time to make a decision.
It's time to make some changes.
It's time to rest.
It's time we had a talk.
It's time we left.
It's time you took my advice.
It's totally up to you.
It's up one floor.
It's up to them now.
It's up to us.
It's up to you and me.
It's up to you now.
It's up to you, Tom.
It's what I've got to do.
It's what you wanted, isn't it?
It's you who are confused.
Just do me one favor.
Just get out of here, OK?
Just get out of my way.
Just get out of there.
Just make this stop.
Just one moment, please.
Just one more, please.
Just take it easy, OK?
Just take it slow.
Just take it slowly.
Just take my hand.
Just take your pick.
Just take your time.
Keep out of this.
Keep Tom out of here.
Keep Tom out of trouble.
Learn what you can learn.
Learn what you can.
Let go of my son.
Let me out of here.
Let them win one.
Let these people go.
Let us know what you decide.
Let's get the other one.
Let's get this started.
Let's not fight, OK?
Let's see you talk your way out of this one.
Let's take a chance.
Let's talk about it later.
Let's talk about what we're going to do about it.
Let's think of something to do.
Let's get you to the hospital.
Listen to me, all of you.
Look at all these flowers.
Look at that one there.
Look out for yourself.
Look what we have here.
Lunch would be great.
Make Tom go away.
Mary is a lovely woman.
Mary is my wife's middle name.
Maybe I'll do that.
Maybe I'll have to wait.
Maybe that was the last one.
Maybe Tom isn't the one who's lying.
Maybe we can buy Tom a new one.
Maybe we can help.
Maybe we won't have to wait.
Maybe we'll get lucky.
Maybe you can help.
Men are all the same.
Mistakes are made all the time.
Move over, will you?
My car's out back.
My middle name is Tom.
My parents aren't going to be there.
My time has come.
My vision's getting worse.
Neither one of them are here.
Neither one of them disagrees.
No one can be that disgusting.
No one can do anything.
No one can have it all.
No one can help.
No one can leave.
No one can say anything.
No one can say.
No one can see.
No one had seen anything.
No one has an answer.
No one has an explanation.
No one has anything.
No one has been murdered.
No one has said a word.
No one has that right.
No one has the answer.
No one is doing anything.
No one is expendable.
No one is going to die.
No one is going to understand you.
No one is going with me.
No one is home.
No one is innocent.
No one is invulnerable.
No one is that lucky.
No one is there.
No one is thrilled.
No one is to leave.
No one knew who he was.
No one knows anything.
No one knows that.
No one knows we're here.
No one said it was a diamond.
No one saw a thing.
No one saw me.
No one saw that.
No one was helping.
No one was with me.
No one will be hurt.
No one will help us.
No one will listen to me.
No one will see us.
Nobody can be that lucky.
Nobody cares about this except you.
Nobody's going to die.
Nobody's going to jail.
None of this would've happened if we'd been more careful.
Nothing can be done.
Nothing can go wrong.
Nothing is going on.
Nothing will be the same.
Nothing's going to go wrong.
Nothing's out of order.
Now get out of my hair.
Now get out of my room.
Now get out of my way.
Now get us out of here.
Now go on inside.
Now is not the time for explanations.
Now we can be together.
Now we can go.
Now we'll have some fun.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Now what do we do?
Obviously, there's to be some kind of mistake.
Open this, will you?
People are getting killed.
People are getting scared.
People are going to die.
People can be so rude.
People will be suspicious.
Perhaps that would be possible.
Perhaps there has been some mistake.
Perhaps Tom knows who did it.
Perhaps we can help.
Perhaps you should get one.
Perhaps you should've gotten a bigger one.
Pick up the gun.
Pick up the knife.
Pick up the phone.
Please be ready in fifteen minutes.
Please get out of my house.
Please get out of the kitchen.
Please get out of the pool.
Please get out.
Please make it stop.
Please take the job.
Please take your seat, sir.
Please take your seats.
Please take your time.
Praying for Tom is all you can do.
Pull up a chair.
Pull up to the curb.
Put on some music.
Put that one back.
Relax, will you?
Roll up your sleeve, please.
Roll up your sleeves.
Save a piece of cake for me.
Say what is in your heart.
Say what you have to say.
Scream all you want. No one will hear you.
See what Tom has to say about all this.
See what you can do with it.
See what you can find.
Should we get a table?
Should we get started?
Should we go someplace?
Should you be out of bed?
Shouldn't we be talking about what happened?
Shouldn't we do something about it?
Shouldn't we get our stuff?
Shouldn't we get started?
Shouldn't we leave?
Shouldn't we try to help?
Shouldn't you be at school now?
Shouldn't you be in bed?
Shut up and do it.
Shut up, will you?
Slow down, will you?
So, what are we going to do?
So, what are you up to tonight?
So, what do we do in the meantime?
So, what do you think of it?
So, what do you think?
So, will you go out with me?
Some of you won't make it.
Somebody is or was here.
Somebody's going to pay.
Somebody's got to do it.
Somebody's got to do something.
Someday, we'll know.
Somehow, Tom knew.
Someone is going to get hurt.
Someone is going to notice.
Someone's been here recently.
Something has gone wrong.
Something will have to be done.
Soon, we'll know why.
Spend some time with me.
Stand up for yourself.
Stay out of my business.
Stay out of my kitchen.
Stay out of this, Tom.
Take it somewhere else.
Take over, will you?
Take some time off.
Take that one there.
Take the next bus.
Take the next one.
Take them all to my office.
Take Tom out of here.
Take your time with it.
Talking to Tom isn't going to help.
Tell him who you are.
Tell them they're going to have to wait.
Tell Tom he's going to have to wait.
Tell Tom he's going to have to work late today.
Tell Tom I'll do it.
Tell Tom it was all your fault.
Tell us about them.
Tell us about your brother.
Tell us all about it.
Tell us all the gossip.
Tell us something we don't know.
Thank you all for your attention.
Thank you for all of your work.
Thank you for all your help.
Thank you one and all.
Thanks for your help on this one.
Thanks to all of you.
That all makes sense.
That can be arranged.
That isn't going to happen.
That isn't going to help.
That makes a big difference, doesn't it?
That makes a difference, doesn't it?
That makes it easier.
That makes it harder.
That may have been the last one.
That probably wouldn't be appropriate.
That probably wouldn't be considered appropriate.
That probably wouldn't be the right thing to do.
That was a good one.
That was so amazing.
That was so awesome.
That was so creepy.
That was so funny.
That was so good.
That was Tom's choice.
That was Tom's cousin.
That wasn't one of the choices.
That wasn't so bad.
That wasn't so difficult, was it?
That wasn't so hard, was it?
That wasn't there before.
That wasn't there this morning.
That will be all.
That will not be difficult.
That will not be necessary.
That will not be permitted.
That will not be possible.
That will not change.
That will not do.
That will take hours.
That would be a challenge.
That would be a change.
That would be a pity.
That would be a relief.
That would be a shame.
That would be a tragedy.
That would be acceptable.
That would be advisable.
That would be all right.
That would be amazing.
That would be an improvement.
That would be an understatement.
That would be awesome.
That would be awkward.
That would be best.
That would be different.
That would be disastrous.
That would be embarrassing.
That would be exciting.
That would be fair.
That would be fun.
That would be good.
That would be gross.
That would be hard.
That would be helpful.
That would be ideal.
That would be illegal, right?
That would be insane.
That would be interesting.
That would be logical.
That would be lovely, wouldn't it?
That would be nice, don't you think?
That would be nice, wouldn't it?
That would be nonsense.
That would be one reason.
That would be one theory.
That would be relevant.
That would be rude.
That would be satisfactory.
That would be so awkward.
That would be something.
That would be suicidal.
That would be treason.
That would be uncomfortable.
That would be unethical.
That would be unfortunate.
That would be unlikely.
That would be unprofessional.
That would be unreasonable.
That would be unusual.
That would be weird.
That would be wonderful.
That would be wrong.
That would do the trick.
That would make all the difference in the world.
That would make all the difference.
That would make sense.
That would not be appropriate.
That would not be easy.
That would not be wise.
That would take hours.
That would take time.
That would've been awesome.
That would've been awful.
That would've been hilarious.
That would've been nice.
That would've been smart.
That would've been the right thing to do.
That would've been the smart thing to do.
That wouldn't be appropriate.
That wouldn't be good.
That wouldn't be practical.
That wouldn't be wise.
That'll be difficult.
That'll take some time.
That's a very interesting one.
That's all I'll say.
That's all in the past.
That's all it takes sometimes.
That's all that happened.
That's all that matters.
That's all there is to it.
That's all there is.
That's all there was to it.
That's all there was.
That's all Tom had to do.
That's all Tom has to say.
That's all Tom needed.
That's all Tom said.
That's all Tom wanted.
That's all Tom wants.
That's all we can ask.
That's all we do here.
That's all we know about Tom.
That's all we're offering.
That's all you can do.
That's all you have to do.
That's exactly what I need.
That's exactly what Tom needs.
That's exactly what we need.
That's going to be difficult.
That's going to be tough.
That's going to take forever.
That's going to take time.
That's got to be painful.
That's got to be uncomfortable.
That's got to make a difference.
That's not exactly a top priority.
That's not going to be all that difficult.
That's not going to be easy.
That's not going to be enough.
That's not going to be fun.
That's not going to work, is it?
That's not going to work.
That's not so bad.
That's not so good.
That's not so long.
That's not so many.
That's not something you forget.
That's not what it means.
That's not what that means.
That's not what that was.
That's not what they're after.
That's not what this is about.
That's not what we did.
That's one of mine.
That's one of my concerns.
That's one of my favorites.
That's one of our rules.
That's one of ours.
That's one of the reasons.
That's one of them.
That's possible, but it will take time.
That's the best one.
That's the going rate.
That's the last one.
That's the one we want.
That's up to Tom.
That's up to you.
That's what all this is about, isn't it?
That's what I need.
That's what I'll do.
That's what I've been avoiding.
That's what I've been doing.
That's what I've been saying.
That's what I've ordered.
That's what it said in the paper.
That's what makes it so difficult.
That's what makes it so interesting.
That's what makes this so difficult.
That's what makes you so special.
That's what matters, right?
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
That's what Tom was hiding.
That's what we all thought.
That's what we do best.
That's what we do here.
That's what we have to discuss.
That's what we need to do.
That's what we need.
That's what we think.
That's what we want, isn't it?
That's what we were thinking.
That's what we're hoping.
That's what will happen.
That's what you all say.
That's what you do best, isn't it?
That's what you do best.
That's what you promised.
That's what you said yesterday.
That's what you want, isn't it?
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
That's what you would think.
That's what's going on.
The cat's out of the bag.
The game's about to begin.
The meeting's about to start.
The plan would've worked, if you hadn't interfered.
The pleasure's all mine.
The police seem to know exactly where we are.
The project is not going well.
The world's gone crazy.
There are people out there.
There goes your ride.
There has got to be an explanation.
There has to be something here.
There is one catch.
There is one possibility.
There is one solution.
There is someone here.
There is something else.
There is something here.
There is something more.
There is something we can do.
There is something wrong.
There isn't going to be a change.
There isn't going to be an investigation.
There isn't time for that.
There isn't time to do that.
There isn't time to explain.
There was another one.
There was more than one.
There was one witness.
There was something else.
There was something in the air.
There will be an investigation.
There will be difficulties.
There'll be plenty of time for that later.
There's been some trouble.
There's going to be a storm.
There's going to be an investigation.
There's got to be an answer.
There's not going to be a party.
There's not going to be a wedding.
There's nothing you can do about that.
There's only one place Tom could've gone.
There's only room for one of us.
There's only room for one.
There's somebody in there.
There's somebody out there.
There's someone I've got to see.
There's someone in the backyard.
There's someone in the basement.
There's someone in there.

Under the Tatoeba guidelines, it is recommended that members only add sentences in their native language and/or translate from a language they can understand into their native language. The reason for this is that it is much easier to form natural-sounding sentences in one's native language.

Why, of course, the people don't want war. Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. [...] Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

To give a person one's opinion and correct his faults is an important thing. It is compassionate and comes first in matters of service. But the way of doing this is extremely difficult. To discover the good and bad points of a person is an easy thing, and to give an opinion concerning them is easy, too. For the most part, people think that they are being kind by saying the things that others find distasteful or difficult to say. But if it is not received well, they think that there is nothing more to be done. This is completely worthless. It is the same as bringing shame to a person by slandering him. It is nothing more than getting it off one's chest.

Mary pulled the ironing board out of the closet and unfolded it, setting it up beside the window.
Mary thought to herself that she ought to buy a new cover for the ironing board since the old one was getting pretty tattered.
Mary took the iron off the shelf, unwrapped the electrical cord, plugged in the iron and chose a heat setting.
As the iron was heating up, Mary poured distilled water into the reservoir to make steam.
Always use distilled water in steam irons because using ordinary water will cause a mineral build-up over time that will clog the steam holes.
Use the highest heat settings only when you're ironing fabrics made of natural fibers like cotton or linen.
Using high heat settings while ironing synthetic fabrics will melt the synthetic fibers and cause visible permanent damage, which often looks like a shiny area where the too-hot iron had the longest contact with the fabric.
When she was finished ironing, Mary switched off the iron and unplugged it, then left it alone for a while to let it cool.
After the iron had cooled off, Mary wrapped the electrical cord around the iron, put the iron back on the shelf, folded up the ironing board, and put it away back in the closet.
