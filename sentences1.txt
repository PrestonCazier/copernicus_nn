I had been to the hospital before you came.
I took it for granted that you would come.
I had no idea that you were coming.
It doesn't matter whether you come or not.
It does not matter to me whether you come or not.
It's a pity that you can't come.
As long as you are here, we might as well begin.

Either you or your friend is wrong.
I'm amazed by the ease with which you solve the problem.
I will have left when you return.
He will have left here by the time you return.

As you have insulted him, he is cross with you.
We thought it wrong that you should punish him.

Imagine yourself to be in his place.
You did well not to follow his advice.
It was foolish of you to accept his offer.
You did wrong to refuse his help.
Either you or he is wrong.
Either you or he has to attend the meeting.

The success resulted from your efforts.
We were just talking about you when you called.
It is difficult for you to climb to the mountaintop.
It's quite plain that you haven't been paying attention.
Your advice led me to success.
It is a pity that you can't join us.

I sincerely hope that you will soon recover from your illness.
Unless you make a decision quickly, the opportunity will be lost.
I hope that you will get well soon.
I found the very thing you had been looking for.
It is plain that you have done this before.
I don't care whichever you choose.

You must do your homework at once.
Who took care of the dog while you were away?
I will wait till you have written the letter.
It is strange that you should fail.
You may fail, for all I care.
The reason why you failed is you did not try hard enough.
When you speak of a pay-raise before recognition, I am inclined to think you are putting the cart before the horse.
A time will come when you will regret your action.
You may as well go yourself.
You should talk to the teacher yourself.
You talk next and you be quiet.
We heard the news that you had passed the exam.

You don't have to go unless you want to.
I don't care as long as you are happy.
Your meaning is beyond me.
What you have said applies only to single women.
What you said surprised me.
Whatever you may say, I won't give it up.
The picture you are looking at is a copy of a Picasso.
The picture you are looking at costs 100,000 yen.
What I can't make out is why you have changed your mind.

Whatever you may say, I don't believe you.
It's good to talk things over before you buy something.
I wish you were close to me.
It was bad of you to get angry at your wife.
Your refusal to help complicated matters.
I can no more speak French than you can speak English.
What is the main purpose of your studying English?
If you could only speak English, you would be perfect.
It's evident that you told a lie.
What is that thing in your right hand?
Would you mind making an extra cup of coffee whenever you decide to have some?
It seems as if you are the first one here.
It is risky for you to go into that area alone.
I enjoyed the holiday all the better for being with you.
As long as you stick to one style, you can't hit upon a wonderful idea.
You are to blame.
You are not to blame, nor is he.
It is plain that you are to blame.
You need not take the trouble to go there.
You're going to leave for London next Sunday, aren't you?
It is because you are lazy that you cannot write your report.
I will come on Monday unless you write to the contrary.
I was about to leave when you telephoned.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
You go first.
I heard it from you.
I stayed home last night to be able to receive your call.
I didn't expect such a nice present from you.
You can do whatever you want to.

I will see to it that you meet her at the party.
Say what you will, I think he is an honest person.
I will help him no matter what you say.
Say what you will; I won't change my mind.
I marvel how you could agree to the proposal.
It is obvious why you have a stomach-ache.
I can imagine how you felt.
However fast you may walk, you can't catch up with him.
Try as you may, you will not be able to read as many as five novels in a day.
Try to estimate how much you spent on books.
I have a good mind to strike you for being so rude.
No matter where you may go, don't forget to write to me.
I must go there irrespective of what you think.
You should have nothing to complain about.
No wonder you could not open the door.
What is it that makes you think that way?
I'm surprised at your behavior.
It's strange you say that.
I will do my best to put such an idea out of your head.
How can I feel relaxed, with you watching me like that?
I can't abide hearing you cry so bitterly.
It is outrageous that you should spend so much money.
It is a pity that you should lose such a chance.
It is foolish of you to believe such a thing.
It's absurd of you to do that.
It is absurd of you to do that.
It is no use your trying to deny it.
It is a great pity that you don't know it.
It makes no difference to me whether you believe it or not.
It makes little difference to me whether you believe it or not.
It is right that you should write it.
The day will come when you will realize it.
The time will come when you'll regret it.
I'm glad you liked it.
You are mad to try to do it all alone.
I wish you had not told the story to my mother.
When was it that you visited the museum?
It is no wonder that you are turning down the proposal.
What made it difficult for you to carry out the plan?
It is absolutely necessary that you be at the meeting.
You have no good reason for thinking as you do.
I cannot believe you did not see him then.
Ten to one you can pass the test.
The time will come when you will be sorry for it.
I'll do it, if you insist.
I can't work with you standing there.
By the time you got there, the sun had set.
You gave me a real surprise when you showed up there.
Since you say so.
You may well say so, but I cannot agree.
There is no reason why you shouldn't do such a thing.
I don't blame you.
I can't allow you to do that.
There are a good many reasons why you shouldn't do it.
I don't blame you for doing that.
We will pay you according to the amount of work you do.
I'm glad you enjoy skiing, but I guess it's just not my cup of tea.

The time will come when you will understand this.
Where was it that you found this key?
I didn't expect you to turn up here.
There is no need for you to stay here.
As long as you're here, I'll stay.
With you here beside me I'm not afraid of anything. You're my fortress.
The watch you gave me doesn't keep time.
I had no notion that you were coming.
My life would be completely empty without you.
You'll be missed by your friends.
We shall all miss you when you go away.
I miss you badly.
How I miss you.
I miss you very much.
We all miss you very much.
We will miss you badly.
Whenever you come, I'm ready.
It is because you work too much that you are sleepy all the time.
Why is it that you are always late?
You may stay here as long as you like.
You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you'll never convince me.
Laugh as much as you like; I'll stick to my plan to the bitter end.
I cannot endure your going.
You walk too fast for me to keep up with you.
If only you had told me the whole story at that time!
It is impossible for you to jump two meters high.
We think it is very dangerous that you're climbing the mountain alone.
Here is a letter for you.
Are you saying that our plan was accepted? I hope you're not showing me any premature happiness here.
You, be quiet!
