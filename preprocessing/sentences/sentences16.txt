In 1543, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus developed the mathematics of the sun-centered solar system and caused a great shift in scientists' view of the universe. His work led to the recognition that Earth does indeed orbit the sun and to the follow-on speculation that other stars had planets circling them.

The invention of the telescope in the early 1600s revolutionized astronomy.
Galileo was one of the first to use the telescope to search the heavens. Among his findings was spotting the four largest moons orbiting around Jupiter.
Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars.
The first extrasolar planet, Pegasi 51 b, was discovered by astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva, using the ELODIE spectrograph on the Observatoire de Haute-Provence telescope in France.

In 2006, scientists launched the French CoRoT mission, the first space mission dedicated to the extrasolar planet hunt. The mission helped astronomers discover dozens more extrasolar planets.
Another step forward in the search for extrasolar planets began with the launch in 2009 of the Kepler space observatory, NASA's first extrasolar mission. Kepler's goal was to search hundreds of thousands of stars for signs of planets.
Kepler has found a diverse array of planets, including exotic, multi-planet solar systems.
Kepler has found that smaller planets (Earth-sized rather than Jupiter-sized) are likely to be the most common in the Milky Way galaxy.
Kepler uncovered several planets that are about the same size as Earth and orbit within the star's habitable zone, where liquid water, which is necessary for life, can exist.
Overall, Kepler has added more than 1,200 confirmed planets to the extrasolar planet count, which now stands at nearly 3,700.
Astronomers also have used NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which observes in infrared light, to study extrasolar planets. In 2007, the Spitzer telescope detected water vapor for the first time on another world.
Hubble made one of the first visible-light images of an extrasolar planet circling the nearby, bright star Fomalhaut, located 25 light-years from Earth.
Hubble also helped astronomers analyze the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.
Hubble made the first measurements of the makeup of the atmospheres of two Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets.
Even if a planet is rocky, Earth-sized, and just the right distance from its star, it also must have an atmosphere that contains the correct ingredients to foster and sustain life.
Venus is Earth's twin by size, but its dense atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide, which helps keep the planet sizzling hot. Venus, therefore, is not hospitable for life.
You better watch your back.
Mary has a nose piercing.
I was extremely naive at the time.
The distant worlds observed by Hubble and other telescopes are just the tip of the iceberg, according to a Hubble survey of the center of our Milky Way. The study revealed that our galaxy should be brimming with 100 billion planets, at least one planet for every star.
The study of worlds outside our solar system will be continued by future spacecraft, such as NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and James Webb Space Telescope.
TESS will find planets in the same manner as Kepler, but search stars that are closer to our sun.
The Webb telescope will use infrared light to examine in detail the extrasolar planetary systems found by TESS and other telescopes.
The James Webb telescope will study the chemical makeup of extrasolar planets' atmospheres.
Who knows what new discoveries these observatories will uncover?
I still have feelings for him to this day.

Tom is a charismatic politician.
About 90 percent of the planets that ever will form are yet to be born.
With roughly 100 billion planets in our galaxy, 100 billion galaxies in the universe, and trillions of years ahead, planet studies in the universe have vast possibilities across both space and time.
About a million years ago, an icy comet began its journey from its home in our distant solar system, hundreds of times farther out than any planet. Now, the comet has finally reached our inner solar system neighborhood as it follows its long path around the Sun.
Comet Siding Spring was discovered in 2013 by astronomers at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.
Since Comet Siding Spring's discovery, astronomers have observed it with many telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope.
Hubble images taken in October 2013 and March 2014 show two jets of dust coming from the comet's core, or nucleus.
The Sun's heat warms the comet's ice, turning it into gas that is blown off as jets.

The comet created excitement among astronomers because it passed very close to Mars.
In 1994, two dozen pieces of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashed into Jupiter. The collision didn't damage the planet, but it left behind black scars in Jupiter's clouds.
We spoke about an article that I had published.
More than a century ago, a comet or a meteor exploded in the sky above the Tunguska River valley in Russia. The explosion knocked down millions of trees over hundreds of miles.
More than 65 million years ago, a large comet hit Earth, leading to the demise of the dinosaurs and most of the planet's other species.

Many of the famous comets are short-period comets, which orbit the Sun in less than 200 years.
The Kuiper Belt is a broad region beyond the orbit of Neptune containing perhaps 100 million small objects made of ice and rock.
Comet Siding Spring is one of the long-period comets, those that require more than 200 years to orbit the Sun. These comets come from the Oort Cloud, a sphere of about a trillion ancient, icy objects located hundreds to thousands of times farther than the planets' orbits.
Every year astronomers observe comets that come from the distant solar system and travel back out again.
The Oort Cloud is so far away from the Sun that its icy objects are not warmed much by the Sun's heat. The objects are frozen fossils from the early solar system.
Once Comet Siding Spring leaves the inner solar system, it will not come back for a couple million years.
Four of the seven planets orbiting the nearby star Trappist-1 might contain large quantities of water.
Trappist-1 is located just 39 light-years away from Earth.

In his book, Huygens described Saturn as being "surrounded by a thin flat ring."
The discovery of Saturn's mysterious ring system led to a rush of observations of the planet during Huygens' time.
Today, astronomers are still studying Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, in an attempt to understand the planet and its ring system.
Other planets have rings, but they are so faint that we cannot easily see them.
Saturn's rings stand out because they are very bright and contain lots of material. Their brightness is due to their makeup. The rings are made of icy material that reflects sunlight, just as ice does on Earth.
Saturn and its ring system are so special that three spacecraft have visited the planet over the past 30 years to take some close-up views.
Saturn, like Jupiter, is a gas giant and does not have a solid surface.
The first spacecraft to fly by Saturn was Pioneer 11 in the late 1970s.
In the early 1980s, Voyager 1 and 2 flew by the ringed planet.
The planet's ring system is made up of about 10,000 rings, called ringlets.
The ring system is about 175,000 miles (280,000 km) across, yet only about half a mile (1 km) thick.
Compared with Saturn's size, the rings appear paper-thin.
Astronomers believe the rings are made of pieces of dusty water ice, which range in size from dust grains to boulders. These particles gently collide with each other as they go around Saturn.
The rings orbit Saturn just as our Moon goes around the Earth.
If our Moon broke apart, the pieces would form a ring around our planet.
At least 100,000 rocky objects called asteroids reside between Mars and Jupiter.
The board of directors held an emergency meeting.
The small wisdom is like water in a glass: clear, transparent, pure. The great wisdom is like the water in the sea: dark, mysterious, impenetrable.
It all started innocently enough.
Scientists believe that asteroids are the leftover building blocks of our solar system planets.
These space rocks orbit the Sun in a large, circular region called the asteroid belt.
The Dawn spacecraft will first visit Vesta in 2011. After orbiting Vesta for nine months, Dawn then will travel to Ceres, arriving in 2015.

Politics is not the art of the possible. It consists in choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.
People are the common denominator of progress. So, paucis verbis, no improvement is possible with unimproved people, and advance is certain when people are liberated and educated.

It is my guiding confession that I believe the greatest error in economics is in seeing the economy as a stable, immutable structure.
The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.
Some years, like some poets, and politicians and some lovely women, are singled out for fame far beyond the common lot, and 1929 was clearly such a year.
No one was responsible for the great Wall Street crash. No one engineered the speculation that preceded it. Both were the product of free choice and decision of hundreds of thousands of individuals.
The values of a society totally preoccupied with making money are not altogether reassuring.
Of all the mysteries of the stock exchange there is none so impenetrable as why there should be a buyer for everyone who seeks to sell.
Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.
A banker need not be popular; indeed a good banker in a healthy capitalist society should probably be much disliked. People do not wish to trust their money to a hail-fellow-well-met but to a misanthrope who can say no.

Among all the world's races, some obscure Bedouin tribes possibly apart, Americans are the most prone to misinformation.
The positions of eminence and authority in Congress are allotted in accordance with length of service, regardless of quality. Superficial observers have long criticized the United States for making a fetish of youth. This is unfair. Uniquely among modern organs of public and private administration, its national legislature rewards senility.
The foresight of financial experts was, as so often, a poor guide to the future.
People of privilege will always risk their complete destruction rather than surrender any material part of their advantage. Intellectual myopia, often called stupidity, is no doubt a reason. But the privileged also feel that their privileges, however egregious they may seem to others, are a solemn, basic, God-given right. The sensitivity of the poor to injustice is a trivial thing compared with that of the rich.
People of privilege will always risk their complete destruction rather than surrender any material part of their advantage.
Economics is not an exact science.
Of all classes, the rich are the most noticed and the least studied.
Money is a singular thing. It ranks with love as man's greatest source of joy. And with death as his greatest source of anxiety.
Few can believe that suffering, especially by others, is in vain. Anything that is disagreeable must surely have beneficial economic effects.
The privileged have regularly invited their own destruction with their greed.
There is merit even in the mentally retarded legislator. He asks the questions that everyone is afraid to ask for fear of seeming simple.
All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not much else, is the essence of leadership.

I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained.
The cops are behind us!
I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought.
So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living.
I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.
The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man.
"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.
"Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"
"By Jove!" I cried; "if he really wants some one to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being alone."
"You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not care for him as a constant companion."

We had an argument last night.
I'll try to be home early.
Immigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules.
And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country.
Our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm.
But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again.
It is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today.
I'm not trashy. I recycle.

Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.
There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his work.
At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure: "I've found it! I've found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand.

"How on earth do you know that?" Asked Mary in astonishment.
He seized me by the coat sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been working.

Gravity doesn't just exist on Earth. It also affects objects in space.
Without gravity, a satellite launched from the Earth would simply drift off endlessly into space, traveling in a straight line, instead of circling the planet.
Weight and mass are not the same.
Mass is a measure of a body's resistance to changes in its state of motion, which depends on the amount of matter it contains.
Weight is the force of gravity exerted on a body due to its mass and its location near another, more massive object.
An astronaut in space can be weightless but cannot be without mass.
Eros, named for the god of love, is a near-Earth asteroid, which often comes close to our planet.
Eros is the first asteroid to be landed upon by a spacecraft.
Ida was the second asteroid to be observed close-up by a spacecraft, when the Space Probe Galileo took pictures as it flew by on Aug 28, 1993. These pictures showed not only that Ida has a cratered surface, but also that it has a small moon, called Dactyl, which is about 1.6 x 1.2 km in diameter and orbiting 90 km away from the asteroid.
Ida's moon, Dactyl, is probably made from pieces that broke off Ida during an impact.
Comet Hale-Bopp has a very large nucleus.
Halley is perhaps the most famous comet in history.
Halley is the comet that proved correct Edmund Halley's prediction that it would reappear.
Comet Halley is responsible for depositing the debris that, when falling through Earth's atmosphere, causes the Orionid meteor showers.
Halley has a highly elongated orbit that takes it very close to the Sun and then flings it out into the outer solar system, well past the orbit of Pluto.
Tom and Mary had a fling.
Eris is the largest known dwarf planet in the solar system. Its elongated orbit takes it far outside of the main region of the Kuiper Belt.
Imagine waking up every day to hurricane-force winds of 200 miles per hour sweeping across the planet, or harmful sulfuric acid rain falling on a scorching hot planet! These kinds of wild weather are routine occurrences on some of our solar-system planets and moons.
Earth has several active volcanoes, giant mountain ranges, and vast, deep canyons.
Earth has several active volcanoes, giant mountain ranges, and vast, deep canyons. It also has lots of liquid water in the form of oceans, lakes, and rivers.
Our solar-system neighbors have ice mountains, frigid, liquid methane lakes, volcanoes that spew poisonous sulfur dioxide, and a colossal canyon as long as the continental U.S.
Put on your long johns, wool socks, parka, and gloves if you travel to Antarctica, the coldest spot on Earth.
Venus's average surface temperature is a scorching 860 degrees Fahrenheit, which is hot enough to melt lead.
Venus's average surface temperature is a scorching 462 C, which is hot enough to melt lead.
We have all been caught outside in a rainstorm.
Pluto can reach temperatures of minus 223 degrees Celsius.
Rain waters our plants and keeps our grass green.
Some parts of the world, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa, receive very little rain. Others, such as India during the late summer monsoon season, can be subject to widespread flooding.
Some of our solar-system neighbors have rain, too, but it is not made up of water, as it is on Earth.
Venus has continuous showers of sulfuric acid rain. However, the acid rain evaporates before it reaches Venus's surface because of the planet's super-hot temperatures.
That sounds like the perfect place for a vacation.
Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has rain that is made up of frigid liquid methane, hitting a bitterly cold surface, where the temperature is minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit.
Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has rain that is made up of frigid liquid methane, hitting a bitterly cold surface, where the temperature is minus 179 degrees Celsius.
Powerful winds on Earth can uproot trees, toss over cars, and destroy houses.
Every single day, 200-mile-per-hour winds whip around Jupiter.
Storms on Jupiter have been clocked at over 400 miles per hour.
Clouds on Saturn can reach speeds of 1,100 miles an hour.
Strong winds can kick up dust storms in dry regions, such as the Sahara Desert.
Large dust storms have swept through the Sahara Desert in North Africa, turning day into night and making it hard to breathe and see.
Dust shrouded Mars for three months before fading away.
In 2005, a massive 400-mile-wide hurricane named Katrina struck New Orleans, La., and neighboring states.
The storm packed winds of 100 to 140 miles per hour, toppling homes and causing widespread flooding.
Katrina, however, cannot compare to a colossal hurricane on Saturn.
The Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years.
Earth has plenty of mountain ranges. The Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains in the U.S. are just two of them.
The highest mountain in the world is Mt. Everest in Nepal, rising more than 29,000 feet into the sky.
The highest mountain in the world is Mt. Everest in Nepal, rising more than 8,800 metres into the sky.
The moon has mountains, too.
The Moon's Mons Hadley Delta is 15,000 feet tall, and makes up part of the rim of a deep crater from an asteroid impact billions of years ago.
The volcanic mountains on Mars rise up to five times higher than Mt. Everest.
Pluto, located on the outskirts of our solar system, has a different kind of mountain range, made up of ice. The ice mountains are about 11,000 feet tall. The New Horizons spacecraft spotted them for the first time when it flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015.
Scientists are still making new discoveries in our solar system.
The Grand Canyon, located in the northwest corner of Arizona, was carved out millions of years ago by water.
The Grand Canyon is one mile deep and about 100 miles long.
The deepest canyon in the world is the Tsangpo Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. The canyon is almost 3.5 miles deep and is slightly longer than the Grand Canyon.
The Valles Marineris canyon on Mars is even deeper and much longer than Tsangpo Canyon, measuring 10 miles deep and stretching about 3,000 miles across, which is about the width of the continental U.S.
History has recorded many violent volcanic eruptions on Earth.
In 1991, Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic outburst in the Philippines produced the second largest eruption of the 20th century. Ash from the blast was ejected as high as 21 miles above Earth. Particles from the eruption created a layer of sulfuric acid haze in Earth's atmosphere, dropping global temperatures by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit between 1991 and 1993.
Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
Olympus Mons, an inactive volcano on Mars, spreads over an area as large as the state of Arizona.
Jupiter's moon, Io, has more than 400 active volcanoes, making it the most geologically active object in the solar system. Several volcanoes on Io produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that rise as high as 300 miles above its surface.
Rivers are plentiful on Earth, and each river has a connection of streams that all flow into it. Some of Earth's solar-system neighbors show evidence that they once had similar river systems.
Observations of Mars, Venus, and Titan reveal a series of thin channels that lead to larger channels. Although now dry, these channels could have once been river systems.
Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.
Earth's polar ice caps consist of water ice. Mars's polar caps, however, are a combination of water ice and carbon-dioxide ice.
The Martian polar caps thaw in summer and freeze in winter, showing that our solar system's planets are dynamic and changing.
Some of the moons in the outer solar system are completely covered in ice. They don't have just polar caps. They have ice shells.
Scientists think there is water beneath the moon's icy crust.
Earth's surface is covered mostly by water.
Some of our solar-system neighbors may have oceans, too, but they are hidden from view under layers of ice.
Beneath the icy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, lies a liquid ocean that may have more water than Earth contains.
Images of Europa's surface show ice that has broken up into ice flows, suggesting that water beneath the surface is moving and cracking the ice.
The ice on Europa is generally hundreds of miles thick.
If you really want a place that harbors life, then Earth is it. Our planet is neither too hot nor too cold. It has fierce storms and winds, but not at the extremes seen elsewhere in the solar system.
As scientists learn about our neighboring worlds, they realize how forbidding these places can be. They also document how wonderful our Earth is and how accommodating it is for life. Earth is our oasis in space.
Earth is our oasis in space.
Earth is our oasis.
Haumea is an oddly-shaped dwarf planet.
Haumea spins rapidly, turning once every four hours, and is believed to be composed mostly of rock with a thin, icy shell and a dark red spot.
Astronomers think a collision with a larger body caused the dwarf planet to lose its surface ice, producing the rapid spin.
Haumea is named for the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Haumea's moons are named for the goddess' two daughters.
Makemake was discovered in March 2005 and is classified as a dwarf planet. Its color is reddish-brown, and it has no atmosphere.
Pluto was the smallest planet until August 2006, when the International Astronomical Union reclassified it as a dwarf planet. It is the largest dwarf planet known.
Pluto is composed of a large rocky core wrapped in thick layers of ices.
Pluto's icy surface and extremely thin atmosphere are predominantly composed of nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.
Pluto's terrain shows remarkable variation including dark/bright regions and smooth/mountainous areas.
Pluto's atmosphere is hazy and extended enough that it is continually being lost into space through interaction with the solar wind.
The key reason why Pluto is no longer considered a planet is that it is one among thousands to millions of other objects orbiting within the Kuiper Belt region. Also, the icy dwarf planet is not massive enough to clear debris from its orbit.
Callisto, the outermost of the four Galilean moons, has an old surface that is perhaps the most heavily cratered of any object in the solar system.
The largest object in the solar system is the sun. It contains 99 percent of the mass of the solar system.
The sun is at the center of the solar system, and the planets, asteroids, moons, and comets orbit the sun.
The Earth is the third planet from the sun.
Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, and Earth is the fifth-largest.
Earth and Venus have a couple of things in common: they are rocky planets and are about the same size.
Venus is different in many ways from Earth. Venus has a harsh environment, is very hot, and has a poisonous atmosphere with acid clouds.
Mars is about half the size of Earth.
The planets are different sizes. From smallest to largest they are: Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter.
Jupiter is roughly 10 times larger than Earth.
Venus and Earth are roughly the same size.
The sun is the closest star to Earth and provides us with most of our energy and light.
Earth turns on its axis once every day.
When we experience darkness, we are facing away from the sun. When we experience daylight, we are facing the sun.
We can't see other stars during the day because the sun's light illuminates Earth's atmosphere.
The sun is glowing, not burning like a fire.
The sun glows because its temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius.
The temperature of a wood fire is less than a thousand degrees Fahrenheit.
Nuclear fusion takes place deep in the sun's core at a temperature of about 15 million degrees Celsius. As the heat travels out through the sun's layers, it becomes much cooler, but still hot enough to glow in visible light.
The inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are closer together than the outer ones (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
The inner planets are closest to the sun. The outer planets are farthest away from the sun.
The planets in the inner solar system are tens of millions of kilometers apart; the planets in the outer solar system are hundreds of millions of kilometers apart.
Comets occasionally visit the inner solar system from their home in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud.
Although comets and asteroids are both tiny objects that orbit in the solar system, their composition differs. Asteroids are mostly rock with some ice, while comets are mostly ice with some rock.
Comets do not always have tails. They develop a fuzzy, shell-like cloud called a coma, and one, two, or three tails when near the sun.
Comets have no coma or tail when far away from the sun.
Comets are part of the solar system. Scientists believe they come from one of two locations within the solar system: the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.
Usually, meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere and never reach the ground. A meteorite is the chunk of material that does reach the ground.
A meteor is a bright streak of light in the sky caused when a meteoroid (a small chunk of rock or ice) enters the Earth's atmosphere and heats up.
Asteroids are not close to each other. They are roughly 1 million miles from each other.
There is only one star, the sun, in the solar system.
Besides the sun, the solar system consists of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets.
The solar system resides in the Milky Way galaxy.
Many other stars are outside our solar system, but part of our Milky Way galaxy.
Galaxies contain from tens of millions to trillions of stars.
Scientists are sending out spacecraft and pointing telescopes to learn more about the solar system.
Among the many questions scientists are trying to answer are whether Mars has liquid water and how the solar system was formed.
The absolute brightness or magnitude of an object is the apparent brightness or magnitude it would have if it were located exactly 10 parsecs away.
The apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.

That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus.
For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.
Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular.
Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with.
Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the city.
Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.
On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.
As the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life gradually deepened and increased.
His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer.
In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller.
His eyes were sharp and piercing.
His thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision.
His chin had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination.
His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.
The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself.
My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence.
His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.
Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.
My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.
That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.
"You appear to be astonished," he said, smiling at my expression of surprise.
"You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."
You say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.
During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.
One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more.
He could come at any moment.

"Have you read Gaboriau's works?" I asked. "Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?" Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. "Lecoq was a miserable bungler," he said, in an angry voice; "he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was his energy. That book made me positively ill."
I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous.
No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done.
"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?" I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers.
"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes," he said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.
My respect for his power of analysis increased wondrously.
"How in the world did you deduce that?" I asked.
"I have no time for trifles," he answered, brusquely.
He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.'
"Get your hat," he said. "You wish me to come?" "Yes, if you have nothing better to do."
A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.
Tom and Mary played a board game with their friends.
What's your favorite board game?
It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath.
My companion was in the best of spirits.
As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.
It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.
Stop, driver, stop!
We finished our journey upon foot.
A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street.
I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from his intention.
With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings.
There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil; but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.
I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden from me.
At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companion's hand with effusion.
Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically.
"With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out," he said.
Gregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way.
"I think we have done all that can be done," he answered; "it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things."
A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew; and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.
Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble.
The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.
A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him.
His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked, as though his death struggle had been a grievous one.
On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features.
I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark, grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.
"There is no clue?" said Gregson. "None at all," chimed in Lestrade.
Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and kneeling down, examined it intently.
"You are sure that there is no wound?" he asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round. "Positive!" cried both detectives.
"It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?" "No, sir."
Tom and Mary played a game of Scrabble.
I've been looking for this for a long time.
Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John that she did that.
Do you think anyone would object if we did that?
I am drinking a cup of Blueberry Tea in the teahouse.

But no, you preferred to go to the more expensive supermarket.
Tom invented the whole story.
Every category has its disadvantages and advantages.
There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.
Could you spell your name, please?
As he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.
Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.
"You can take him to the mortuary now," he said. "There is nothing more to be learned."
"There's been a woman here," he cried. "It's a woman's wedding-ring."
There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.
"This complicates matters," said Gregson. "Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before."
What did you find in his pockets?
It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.
Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.
I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.
The little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.
He struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.
"Look at that!" he said, triumphantly.
You're not going like that, are you?
You're not going to the party like that, are you?
You're not going to the party dressed like that, are you?

Give me your names.
Tell me some funny jokes.
Tell me some rib-ticklers.
A truth can only take effect when the recipient is ripe for it.
Why so?
She's my sister's friend.
It's all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.
"I really beg your pardon!" said my companion, who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter.
So engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope.
He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his off fore-leg.
"One other thing, Lestrade," he added, turning round at the door: "'Rache,' is the German for 'revenge'; so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel."
With which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him.
Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram.
"You amaze me, Holmes," said I. "Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave."
I cannot explain how this could happen.
"My head is in a whirl," I remarked; "the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows."
It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel.
I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick.
You have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.
My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.
Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.
We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved.
Holmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. "We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips," he said.
"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can," the constable answered, with his eyes upon the little golden disk.

Many issues were raised during the meeting. I'll mention, briefly, the most important of them.
I don't want anything to do with that.
I don't want to even look at it.
You're the one who brought it up.
"There's a half-sovereign for you," my companion said, standing up and taking his hat.
"The blundering fool!" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings. "Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it."
There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.
The fridge was empty.
The refrigerator was empty.
Tom came home for the summer.
I hate going to the gym.
Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon.
After Holmes' departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep.
My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.
Where there is no imagination there is no horror.

What's the matter? You're not looking quite yourself.
I'm so sorry about that.
Have you seen the evening paper?
"Have you any arms?" "I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges."
I went to my bedroom and followed his advice.
Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.
"The plot thickens," he said, as I entered.
Put your pistol in your pocket.
Don't frighten him by looking at him too hard.
"It is eight o'clock now," I said, glancing at my watch.
He will probably be here in a few minutes.
As he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell.
"Does Dr. Watson live here?" asked a clear but rather harsh voice.
"Come in," I cried.
At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment.
She appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light.
After dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers.
I glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.
"Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer," I interrupted; "it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able to restore it to the rightful owner."
"I'll follow her," he said, hurriedly; "she must be an accomplice, and will lead me to him."
Looking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the other side while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.
"Either his whole theory is incorrect," I thought to myself, "or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery."
Ten o'clock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed.
It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key.
The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not been successful.
"You don't mean to say," I cried, in amazement, "that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her?"
"Old woman be damned!" said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. "We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip."
It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him.
I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.
The papers next day were full of the "Brixton Mystery," as they termed it.
The Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists.
After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.
Aqua Tofana was a poison used in Naples and Rome in the 17th century.
The Marquise de Brinvilliers was accused of having conspired with her lover, the Chevalier de Sainte Croix, to poison her father and her two brothers in order to inherit their estates.
There were rumours that Brinvilliers had poisoned poor people during her visits to hospitals.
He only had one thing in mind.
She only had one thing in mind.
Tom only had one thing in mind.
They only had one thing in mind.
You should check the speed of your Internet connection.
The Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority.
It was the first time that Tom had ever been on a ferry.
Why can't you go to the police?
Tom tried to cover his tracks.
That would be counter-productive.
She was in a bad mood for the rest of the day.
Tom was in a bad mood for the rest of the day.
Tom's mom unplugged the TV just as he was about to beat the final boss.
Tom and Mary watched a scary movie together.
The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis.
He was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary.
The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express.
Tom spent all of his money at the arcades.
Tom needs to understand that this type of behavior is unacceptable.
We spoke on the phone last night.
His brother was the same way.
I think we should repaint this room.
We should paint the kitchen while we're at it.
Tom thanked his lucky stars.
Mary thanked her lucky stars.
English is the language of unlimited possibilities.
They were afterwards seen together upon the platform.
Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery.
It's heads I win and tails you lose.
"Have you found it, Wiggins?" "No, sir, we hain't," said one of the youths.
Here are your wages.
He handed each of them a shilling.
He waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.
"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force," Holmes remarked.
The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything.
They are as sharp as needles.
Tom sounded very confident.
It is merely a matter of time.
There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-headed detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room.
"My dear fellow," he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand, "congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day."
A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.
"Do you mean that you are on the right track?" he asked.
"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars," he said.
Will you have some whiskey and water?
The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.
"You do me too much honour," said Holmes, gravely.
The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his cigar.
Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.
"The fun of it is," he cried, "that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn."
The idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.
Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves.
"You remember the hat beside the dead man?" "Yes," said Holmes; "by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road."
'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.
The daughter burst into tears.
I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.
"At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?" I asked.
A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question. Her features turned perfectly livid.
There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm, clear voice.
"No good can ever come of falsehood, mother," she said.
"God forgive you!" cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and sinking back in her chair. "You have murdered your brother."'
"Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth," the girl answered firmly.
"You had best tell me all about it now," I said.
Half confidences are worse than none.
I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be compromised.
Have you ever tried speed dating?
He and his secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent.
I noticed a "Copenhagen" label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place.
He was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways.
Stangerson was a quiet, reserved man.
After twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be sober.
His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.
My heart grew light when I saw him drive away.
My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister.
When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind.
Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.
What happened then I do not know.
I was too terrified to raise my head.
When I did look up, I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.
"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again," he said.
With those words he took his hat and started off down the street.
The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.
I saw that the whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.
When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber.'
My theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach perhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark.
The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house.
As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.
On his way home he met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him.
On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply.
I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well.
Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!
It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room.
The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his demeanour and dress were however, wanting.
His face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy.
He stood in the centre of the room fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do.
"The secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson," said Lestrade gravely, "was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning."
The plot was predictable.
I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.
"Stangerson too!" he muttered. "The plot thickens."
I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.
I was the first to discover what had occurred.
The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.
I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats
I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making inquiries entirely without avail.
From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.
He nearly fainted when he saw it.
She nearly fainted when she saw it.
The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in.
The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress.
He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold.
The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.
"And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?" I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. "The word RACHE, written in letters of blood," he said.
We were all silent for a while.
There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes.
My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle, tingled as I thought of it.
A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel.
The man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat.
We found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.
"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?" he asked.
Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken.
Whatever the motive of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.
There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.'
I thanked my lucky stars.
The man's novel, with which he had read himself to sleep, was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him.
There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.
Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. "The last link," he cried, exultantly. "My case is complete."
The two detectives stared at him in amazement.
"I have now in my hands," my companion said, confidently, "all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts."
I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms.
The dog's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence.
Of the two pills in that box, one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless.
It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.
"All this seems strange to you," continued Holmes, "because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it."
It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious, because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn.
Can you name the man who did it?
We all think that we're unique.
Humans are basically all the same.
We have both tried, and we have both failed.
"Any delay in arresting the assassin," I observed, "might give him time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity."
"There will be no more murders," he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. "You can put that consideration out of the question."
You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him.
I wonder who sent the flowers?
Mary received flowers from a secret admirer.
"Gentlemen," he cried, with flashing eyes, "let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson."
I have a vivid recollection of that instant.
For a second or two we might have been a group of statues.
Then with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes' grasp, and hurled himself through the window.
So powerful and so fierce was he that the four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit.
In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilization. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.
There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon the prairies.
The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness.
In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco.
On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow.
It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.
An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty.
His face was lean and haggard, and his brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones.
His long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white.
His eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre.
The hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton.
As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support.
His clothes hung baggily over his shrivelled limbs.
The great salt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture.
And then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die.
And then he realized that his wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. "Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence," he muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.
The child was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her companion.
"Where's mother?" "Mother's gone; I guess you'll see her before long."

Tom and Mary spread their sleeping bags inside the tent.
"Then mother's a deader too," cried the little girl, dropping her face in her pinafore and sobbing bitterly.
I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!
"Do you mean that we are going to die too?" asked the child, checking her sobs, and raising her tear-stained face. "I guess that's about the size of it."
"Why didn't you say so before?" she said laughing gleefully. "You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again."
I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she meets us at the door of heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of.
The man's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon.
In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.
"Say, did God make this country?" "Of course He did," said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected question. "He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri," the little girl continued. "I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees."
The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her protector.
He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.
As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West.
Leave your horses below and we will await you here.
n a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity.
They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.
The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline.
On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness.
His placid face and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep.
Beside him lay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown sinewy neck; and her golden-haired head resting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic.
On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers, uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.
The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers, who stared about them in bewilderment.
Tom slept through his Chemistry exam.
The exam is 3 hours long.
She blew a kiss at him.

This is a touchy topic.
Tom ate roast pigeon at a Chinese restaurant.
Thanks, mate!
Whatever you say, mate.
I must see her and press her to my heart. I love her to the point of madness, and I cannot continue to be separated from her. If she no longer loved me, I would have nothing left to do on earth.
When someone loves you, the way they say your name is different.. You just know that your name is safe in their mouth. When you love somebody, your eyelashes will go up and down little stars come out of you.
Time is relative.
I have just finished cleaning the floor.
Where do you think you're going, lady?
Sami criticized Layla's parenting skills.
Where is all of our money?
I can't live like this. We have nothing.
We are through here. I'm filing for divorce.
You're gonna be late for the graduation.
I know it's my graduation.
My mom is coming over today.
Is Mom coming over?
I haven't even got up yet.
Join us outside.
It's the graduation of my daughter.
Sami lost his glasses in the pool.
Just shut up your big mouth.
Just shut up, will you?
I really need to talk to my boyfriend.
You have ruined my make-up.
I'm your cousin.
You're so charming.
You're so brave.
"Who's that fat ass?" "She's his new girlfriend."
Sami's wife looks like a big ball of fat.
Nobody loves me in this house.

They will kill you and feed you to the dogs.
You're lucky they didn't kill you and feed you to the dogs.
If you try to escape again, I'll kill you.
You better calm down.
Mission accomplished, general.
Welcome back to your home.
Who are those girls?
Why are you doing all this cruelty to me?
I know exactly what you're saying.
If you do what I say, we could leave this place alive.
You better shut up.
You better shut up and stay calm. If they realize we're here, they'll kill all the men and rape all the women.
There are enemies everywhere.
We'll defeat them in the end.
Your stepmother is a despicable serpent.
Open the door, it's Sami.
Please. I'm begging you!
Did I ask you to tell me what you do?
The only thing you have to do is to keep your mouth shut.
I beg you. I have a wife and children.
Did they rape you?
Were you... raped?
Are you telling me that he raped you?
I want this woman out now.
My daughter disappeared.
Officer, I beg you to help me.
You have to help me find her.
Will you shut up now?
I'll keep my mouth shut this time.
You're a stinking moron.
There is nothing to negotiate with terrorists.
You're forcing me to do this.
Are they going to rape us?
What will happen now?
Look at you, you're crying. Come here. It's alright.
We're just a bunch of weirdos.
I always to this exercise.
You really don't need to explain anything.
This place is not as terrible as it may seem.
You can call me for anything you need.
You're my beautiful princess.
I want you to promise that you will never cry again.
Now give me that kiss.
Your lips taste like chocolates.
You smell like chocolate.
It really tastes good.
Have you been eating chocolate?
Your lips taste really sweet.
Sami has made a fool of himself.
Can you tell me what you call this?
Layla wants more than hugs and kisses.
I'm willing to give anything for that look.
They will build you a statue.
Don't get stressed. Try again.
I'm planning to throw a big party to welcome Sami.
Bring me the room key.
Please open the door and talk to me.
She's suffering from an illness.
Open the door for God's sake.
You're insulting me.
You think that money is the solution to everything.
I think he's gay.
I don't think he really wanted to rape me.
I don't know how I could have tolerated all of this.
My uncle is a very old man.
I promise I'll talk to him.
Oh, no! What's happening now?
We have one more lunatic in this house.
I cried so hard that night.
Sometimes I just want to run away and disappear.
Keep your plans secret.
I prefer being alone.
Are you telling me that he left you?
Are you telling me that the left you alone?
Sami is the greatest daddy on the planet.
You're not wearing gloves.

It's been forever since I didn't go to the beach.
I'm so excited. We're going to the beach today.
"Where do you think you're going?" "To the beach." "You must be kidding. Just look at this room. There will be no beach if you don't clean up this mess."
"I'm your mother." "Stepmother."
Can you skip the intro?
You're not even my mom.

L'amour, it causes many fatalities, does it not?

Life is like a train, Mademoiselle. It goes on.
Journeys end in lovers meeting.
Tom was hanged for a murder he did not commit.
The impossible cannot have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.
Crime is terribly revealing. Try and vary your methods as you will, your tastes, your habits, your attitude of mind, and your soul is revealed by your actions.
"You know that in all tombs there is always a false door?" Renisenb stared. "Yes, of course." "Well, people are like that too. They create a false door - to deceive."
"It is the kind of thing that happens to you when you are stupid," said Esa. "Things go entirely differently from the way you planned them."
She said she was very tired.
We were lovers.
I fall in love too easily.
Do you think that we were lovers in a past life?
We were lovers for a short time.
We were friends before we were lovers.
It wasn't love, it was just lust.
Tom placed his hands on Mary's shoulders.
You can ask Tom. He saw it, too!

Sami got a strange call from someone whose voice he didn't recognize.
There was no place to go.
Sami was trapped in the basement.

Clowns are almost everywhere these days in popular culture.
Clowns are perhaps best known for performing in traveling circuses.
Clowns have been making crowds laugh for generations.
What clowns represent in popular culture has changed a lot over the past 400 years.
Clowns have existed in different forms for a long time. Researchers have found evidence of clowns in ancient Rome, China, and Africa. Their job was to make the ancient rulers laugh.
At least one Native American group, the Hopi Tribe, also has a tradition involving clown-like characters.
Clowns began appearing in the form we recognize today in the 17th century, as a character known as a harlequin. They were common in European theater, and played a character who acted foolish or played tricks.
A harlequin wore colorful clothing and covered his face with a mask to protect his identity.
Clowns from Europe arrived in North America after England began exporting circuses, with their clowns, other performers and trained animals.
Starting in the early 1900s, circus shows were very successful in the United States.
In the 1950s and 1960s, the popularity of clowns grew because of television.
Bozo the Clown appeared in a number of TV programs for children.
Today that company mascot, Ronald McDonald, is world famous.
The image of a happy clown is largely an American creation. So says Benjamin Radford, who wrote a book called Bad Clowns. In other cultures, he says, the clown character is not necessarily good.
Radford said that at first, clown shows were meant for adults, not children. In fact, clown characters were meant to be a critique of society or projections of the fears and concerns of everyday people.
In the 18th century, English actor Joseph Grimaldi became famous for playing a clown in theaters. Grimaldi himself was reported to be an alcoholic and suffered from depression.
The character made people laugh, but was sad and lonely when he left the theater.
Juggalos, as supporters of the rap group Insane Clown Posse are known, gather in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington during a rally, Saturday, Sept. 16, 2017, to protest and demand that the FBI rescind its classification of the juggalos as "loosely organized hybrid gang."
The idea of clowns frightening people started gaining strength in the United States during the 1970s, partly because of John Wayne Gacy.
In the 1980s, evil clowns began appearing in movies like Poltergeist and Killer Klowns from Outer Space.
In the autumn of 2016, many Americans began developing real concerns about clowns.
For most people who work as clowns, their job is to make people happy and laugh.
How often do you get a chance to really laugh or be silly and have fun?
As long as there are still children in the world, there will still be a future for clowns.
Many women like to wear high-heeled shoes.
They may look nice but high-heels can cause pain and are not good for your feet.
Sometimes we call the really high-heeled shoes that women wear "killer heels."
To kick up your heels means to have fun. Some word experts think this expression may have come from the world of horses. Others say it comes from the way you might use your feet when you are waiting for something.
To kick up your heels means to have fun.

Limber pine is beginning to colonize areas of the Great Basin once dominated by bristlecones.
The bristlecone pine is the longest-living thing on Earth.
These trees, with their strangely shaped, wind-beaten limbs, can live up to 5,000 years.
Researchers say warmer weather is permitting a similar kind of tree, the limber pine, to take over good growing places from the ancient bristlecone. They say the tree is being crowded out of mountainous areas where it grows.
Scientists at the University of California, Davis, compared the competing species to two old men in a very slow race up a mountainside. This race between such slow-growing trees takes thousands of years.
The bristlecone pine is the oldest individually growing organism.
Bristlecone pines grow in high mountain forests in eastern California, Nevada and Utah.
The bristlecones grow well in limestone soil. Most trees do not grow well in such soil.
In the mountains, the bristlecones face high winds and extreme temperatures.
To survive long periods without water, parts of the trees die, including much of their outer bark. This makes the trees appear dead, except for small green pine needles.
Experts have named the oldest known bristlecone pine "Methuselah." It is somewhere in the White Mountains of California. But it is not marked in any special way, so that people do not try to damage it.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says progress is being made in reducing deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). But it says much more needs to be done to save the almost 40 million people who die every year from preventable causes.
In a new report, the WHO noted that cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes are the biggest killers of people. Every year, the report said, 15 million adults die before they reach old age. It noted they often die in the most productive period of their lives, between the ages of 30 and 70.
The WHO says tobacco use, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity are some of the top reasons for premature death.
Douglas Bettcher is the WHO director for the prevention of non-communicable diseases. He says little progress is being made on cutting premature death from such diseases.
The window of opportunity to save lives is closing.

You're not a doctor, are you?
Tom told me he didn't get it.
Even Tom cried.
You're not a barber, are you?
Tom told me he couldn't walk.
Didn't Tom win?
You'd better do that quickly.
Tom told me he couldn't wait.
Didn't Tom cry?
You should be a veterinarian.
Tom told me he could take it.
Can't Tom swim?
You probably won't win today.
Tom told me he could help us.
Will Tom sing?
You looked like you were wet.
Tom told me he could do that.
Only Tom left.
You looked like you were sad.
Tom told me he called the police.
Does Tom sing?
You looked like you were mad.
Tom told me he believed that.
Did Tom smile?
You looked like you were hot.
Tom told me I did that wrong.
Let Tom sing.
You look like you're worried.
Tom thinks you can't do that.
Did Tom run?
You look like you're wealthy.
Tom thinks that we can't win.
It would've probably been better if Tom hadn't told Mary that he'd spent three years in prison.
You look like you're trapped.
Tom sometimes agrees with me.
I told Tom that I thought Mary was in Boston, but he said that he thought Mary was in Chicago.
You look like you're through.
Tom sleeps eight hours a day.
Tom warned Mary what might happen if she ate the mushrooms John had found in the woods.
You look like you're puzzled.
Tom seems to come every week.
Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to eat the mushrooms Mary found in the woods, would he?
You look like you're pleased.
Tom seemed unable to do that.
Tom wanted to go to Boston with us, but Mary said she wouldn't go if he went with us.
You look like you're nervous.
Tom seemed to like you a lot.
Tom lets Mary sing with his band sometimes, even though she's not a very good singer.

You look like you're healthy.

You look like you're dubious.
Tom seemed to have recovered.
Tom said Mary was going to go the day before yesterday, but he didn't have time.
You look like you're curious.
Tom seemed to be very scared.
Tom would never forgive you if you ate all the cookies that he baked for Mary.
You look like you're certain.
Tom seemed to be very lonely.
Tom didn't seem to know that Mary didn't do what she said she was going to do.
You look like you're annoyed.
Tom seemed to be very afraid.
I expect that Tom will wait until Mary gets there before he starts doing that.
You didn't do that very well.
Tom seemed to be unperturbed.
Tom knew Mary was the one who had done that, even though she said she didn't.
You didn't do that correctly.
Tom seemed to be unimpressed.
Tom and Mary couldn't do that by themselves, so they asked John to help them.
You aren't a barber, are you?
Tom seemed to be unconvinced.
Tom was the only other person who didn't eat any of the salad that Mary made.
Would you mind if I don't go?
Tom seemed to be unconscious.
Tom probably shouldn't have told Mary that he'd spent three years in prison.
Would you ever eat a hamster?
Tom seemed to be unconcerned.
Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary that she should learn how to do that.
Will you go to Boston by car?
Tom seemed to be trustworthy.
Tom said he thought Mary needed at least $300 to buy everything she needed.
Why does that make you angry?
Tom seemed to be sympathetic.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be quicker at doing that than John.
Why does it matter who knows?
Tom seemed to be really busy.
Tom told me he didn't know why Mary didn't do what she was supposed to do.
Why did you agree to do that?
Tom seemed to be ready to go.
Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary that she should learn how to do that.
Who told you I was in Boston?
Tom seemed to be quite upset.
Tom didn't seem to know that Mary hadn't done what she was supposed to do.
Which of you ate my sandwich?
Tom seemed to be quite happy.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be ready by the time we got there.
Where did you swim yesterday?
Tom seemed to be pretty rich.
Tom and Mary spent a lot of time together when they were both in college.
Where are you going tomorrow?
Tom seemed to be pretty busy.
Tom and Mary didn't know how to do that, so they asked John to help them.
What time do you want to eat?
Tom seemed to be pessimistic.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
What kind of car did you buy?
Tom seemed to be overwhelmed.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was glad that that was going to happen.
What kind of bait do you use?
Tom seemed to be nice enough.
Tom and Mary won't know whether they can do that or not unless they try.
What else do you want to buy?
Tom seemed to be intoxicated.
Didn't you know Tom used to win every time he played chess against Mary?
What does that remind you of?
Tom seemed to be intelligent.
Tom is the one who convinced Mary that she should learn how to do that.
What does that actually mean?
Tom seemed to be incompetent.
Tom didn't seem very surprised when I told him that Mary had left town.
What did you do after dinner?
Tom seemed to be heartbroken.
Tom can play the guitar well, but Mary can play the guitar much better.
We're going to that together.
Tom seemed to be happy again.
I wonder whether Tom has ever asked Mary why she dropped out of school?
We're going to do that again.
Tom seemed to be embarrassed.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
We'll be doing that together.
Tom seemed to be disoriented.
Tom told me he didn't know why Mary didn't do what she should've done.
We won't get back home today.
Tom seemed to be discouraged.
Tom told Mary that she didn't have to eat anything she didn't want to.
We won't do that without you.
Tom seemed to be daydreaming.
Tom told Mary that John wouldn't eat the stew if it had carrots in it.
We wanted to travel together.
Tom seemed to be comfortable.
Last year, Tom wasn't as fat as Mary, but now he's fatter than she is.
We thought you could do that.
Tom seemed to be celebrating.
I wonder why Tom waited so long before he told Mary what had happened.
We shouldn't do that anymore.
Tom seemed to be a smart guy.
Tom would've be doing that now if Mary hadn't done it for him yesterday.
We should get some more food.
Tom seemed to always be busy.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be present at today's meeting.
We need to decide what to do.
Tom seemed surprisingly calm.
Tom told Mary that she didn't have to do anything she didn't want to.
We don't have any water left.
Tom seemed somewhat confused.
Tom says it makes no difference to him whether Mary does that or not.
We don't have any more water.
Tom seemed slightly confused.
Tom says he used to win all the time when he played tennis with Mary.
We do that a lot at my house.

We can't do that without you.
Tom seemed extremely excited.
Tom and Mary got married just after they both graduated from college.
We already know you did that.
Tom seemed different somehow.
Tom and Mary don't often win when playing tennis with John and Alice.
Today I get off work at 2:30.
Tom seemed a little hesitant.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary already knew about what had happened.
This room isn't large enough.
Tom says he's heard you sing.
Tom thought Mary might not want to do that on a cold day like today.
This movie isn't interesting.
Tom says he'll do that again.
Tom says Mary will stay with her grandparents in Boston next summer.
This is a pear, not an apple.
Tom says he doesn't ever win.
I think Tom will eventually give up and ask Mary to do that for him.
There's no way I can do that.
Tom said he's not doing that.
Tom wasn't the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to do that.
Please show me around Boston.
Tom said he'd definitely win.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be interested in doing that.
Please let me do the washing.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
Tom told Mary that she should stop eating at fast food restaurants.

Tom was hoping he could persuade Mary to go to the dance with him.
My wife and I live in Boston.

May I borrow this dictionary?
Tom probably cried yesterday.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy going skin diving with Mary.
Let's do this somewhere else.

Tom said he doesn't think Mary really had to go yesterday morning.
It's the only way to do that.
Tom only does that on Monday.
Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to do that.
It'll take about three hours.
Tom may leave if he wants to.
Tom is the only one who didn't know that Mary had moved to Boston.
It was yesterday that I went.

If you want to stay, you may.
Tom looked like he was drunk.

With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more.
His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his lands.
His farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly.
As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more ruddy and her step more elastic.
Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their minds as they watched her lithe, girlish figure tripping through the wheat-fields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.
Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California.
She had a commission from her father in the city, and was dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed.
She had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains.
"Good-bye," he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her little hand.
Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.
The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths.
The love which had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper.
He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook.
He had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days.
He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman.
He soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own.
One summer evening he came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him.
He threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.
"I am off, Lucy," he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly down into her face; "I won't ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?" "And when will that be?" she asked, blushing and laughing.
There's no one who can stand between us.
"And how about father?" she asked.
The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go.
He tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving.
She stood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house the happiest girl in all Utah.
Oh, father, father, what shall we do?
She could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.
As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate.
Still more surprised was he on entering to find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse, bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in his pockets whistling a popular hymn.
"There are two ways out of the room," cried Ferrier; "there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?"
He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.
Outside all was calm and quiet.
The stars were twinkling brightly overhead.
It's Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the Hope family in Utah.
I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine.
"How much money have you?" "Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes."
The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done.
"We must make our start at once," said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice.
Are you taking the piss?
The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields.
Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting.
By daybreak we should be halfway through the mountains.
Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her more valued possessions.
Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden.
With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across the garden, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfield.
They had just reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.
His prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx.
Two dark, jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness.
On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel.
When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them.
In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them.
As they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.
As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing.
The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy.
At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast.
Do I have to do everything myself?
He saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire.
From the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.
On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns.
Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy.
It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence.
Go fetch some water from the well.
For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange, wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him.
Tales were told in the city of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges.
When he reached St. Petersburg, they had departed for Paris; and when he followed them there, he learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen.
"I guess you're going to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.
"I confess," said I, "that I do not quite follow you." "I hardly expected that you would."
Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.
There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.
Can't you even do that right?
Tom walked slowly down the garden path.

Thank God you're awake now.
Sami took some sleeping pills.
Sami threw the pills in the garbage.
Why did you do that? Do you want to die?
You got yourself drunk.
Sami brought me home.
You two slept together. I know that.
I fell asleep on top of Sami.
If there are any doctors here who can help us, please let Tom know.
You're just a spoilt brat.
I think that won't help.
Why did you swallow all those pills?
Are you feeling depressed?
Let's go to a massage parlor.
Is this the way you have found to fight depression?
What's really good for me is to be alone.
I will never go back to that horrible place.
I wanna go back to that house.
Get off me. Don't touch me.
You'll find that apartment cool.
Why don't you try this hat?
Don't you remember what Sami did to Layla?

What kind of music is this?

You both crossed the line this time.
These clothes suit you fabulously.
We're at a boutique called "Dodo."
I don't have time for fairy tales.
I don't have time for such bullshit.
It sounds like a radio soap opera.
Please spare me your stupid philosophy.
This dress is not going to fit me.
Never say that word in my presence.
I need some ice.
Who is responsible for this brilliant idea?
Who was responsible for that stupid idea?
You haven't learned, have you?
Don't say such nonsensical things.
Sami thinks I'm responsible for all his misfortune.
I don't think Sami sees it that way.
Sami shouldn't blame himself for everything that's happened.
Sami is crying like a baby.
If they catch you alive, they'll torture you to death.
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
Are you travelling together?

It's an action film.
It's a Japanese film.
I come every day.
I come every day except Saturday and Sunday.
I called my father.
How old is your little brother?
How old is your little sister?
I live with my family.
I don't have a brother, but I have two sisters.
Sorry, but I don't understand.
Your rage weighs heavily on me.
I prefer to stay here.
I only come on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
It was about time you arrived!
The corpulence of the peasants revealed that there was no shortage of food there.
That's wishful thinking.
That's a banana.
Tom lives on a tropical island.
I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me.
He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at the dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens.
I cannot live without brainwork. What else is there to live for?
"A young lady for you, sir," she said, addressing my companion.
Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner.
She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved, and dressed in the most perfect taste.
There was a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means.
Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was sweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic.
In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature.
I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation.
"You will, I am sure, excuse me," I said, rising from my chair.
"You will, I am sure, excuse me," I said, rising from my chair.
To my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.
I was placed in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh, and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age.
We've arranged a car to pick you up.
We've taken care of all the details.
How could this have happened?
How much time do we have?
Why are you so worried about her?
Why are you so worried about him?
I don't think you're being objective.
Oh, look! A shooting star! Make a wish.
Tom can recognize the Big Dipper and Orion.
These three stars form the Belt of Orion.
That's Cassiopeia.
That's Orion's sword.
"Do you remember how our love began?" "Yes, it was a dark and stormy night."
Was it all just a lie?
I need to go and get ready.
Just say the word.
I try not to think about him too much.
I try not to think about her too much.
"Why am I not losing weight?" "That's because you eat too much."
Try not to exert yourself.
Do you think I don't know about you and Mary?
More than three quarters of people in the Middle Ages were farmers. They lived in the shadow of the castles.
Mary fell mysteriously ill.
Tom fell mysteriously ill.
It would be impolite to refuse.
Do you think I don't know about you and Tom?
I try not to think about Tom too much.
Why are you so worried about Tom?
Why are you so worried about what might happen?
Close the door on your way out.
Tom tagged Mary in his tweet.
The future you see is the future you get.
Your current thinking got you here. Only new thinking will get you out.
Risk is an essential part of progress.
A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.
Here in America we drive on the right side of the road. How is it in Japan?
This is how it is done in America. How is it done in Japan?
A ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are built for.
Ships are safe in the harbour, but that's not what ships are for.
Ships are safe in harbour, but they were never meant to stay there.

I got a beating so hard that I thought I wouldn't even live.

Do you think we can ever be forgiven?
I guess we could forgive Sami.
What did your father do to you?
Talk to me. Don't be afraid. Your dad isn't here.
You're on your way to hell.
What did your dad do to your mom?
I loved my family.
I left behind my entire life.
Sami was mentally numb.
Sami couldn't think anymore.
I could hear Sami ranting and raving.
Police put handcuffs on Sami.
And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count; it's the life in your years.
Sami's father was violent and cruel.
They put handcuffs on us.
I have had enough of the craziness of our lives.
Sami is doing the Lord's work.
It's so refreshing to meet a good Muslim couple in this town.
You need to leave here with me.

The fashion show was a great success.
The class is officially over.
If I could, I'd gladly punch Sami in the face.
You're acting like a punk yourself.
Unfortunately, our agency doesn't allow this.
You can no longer represent my agency after this incident.
What happened at the club?
Of course I'll be there to keep you company.
We have some problems at the agency.
We'll have to get Sami a new psychiatrist.
I would like to spend more time with my aunt.
I know how you love surprises.
What's the surprise?
It's not a madhouse. It's a clinic for the mentally unstable.
All they talk about is nonsense.
It's like we're having a party here.
I'm going to be the first one to take a bath.
Why did they fire you from the agency?
Sami will pay for this insult.
Did somebody say we're gonna have a party?
We're having a party to welcome Sami home.
Is that gift for me?
Why don't you go to a salon to meet people?
The small bottle of pills wasn't enough to kill Sami.
Sami doesn't live the life of a saint.
I think that what Sami needs is a passionate woman, not someone like Layla.
You've got to learn to harness your strength.
Let me go or I'll scream.
Get out of that bed.
I'm going to report you for murder.
I won't accept any more insults from you.
I'm tired of seeing your faces.
Whoever did this has to pay for it.
I'm pregnant and I'm going to have your child.
You've just made the worst mistake of your life.
Hold your horses. You're crossing the line here!
Sami brings bad luck.
I was taking a shower.
I came to give Layla her surprise.
How dare you call me a hypocrite in front of all my friends?
Shut your mouth immediately.
Sami is such a remarkable dancer.
"Shall we dance?" "Oh, no. I don't know how to dance."
There is no place in this house for Sami.
This is neither the moment nor the place for that.
We'll find some time to be together.
I can't even count on you.
I'm a man who knows very well how to control his emotions.
I'm gonna break Sami's face.
You misunderstood what I said.
This isn't the proper place for this.
I'm sick and tired of this situation.
My husband doesn't love me anymore.
This is neither the moment nor the place.
It's very hard to satisfy a man like Sami.
Are you telling me you don't love me anymore?
Can you please tell me what's the matter with you?
Sami is feeling terribly bad.
This engine works perfectly.
Why are you behaving like that?
Sami looks almost like a dead man.
Does this make you feel good?
"Here is your coffee." "Take it. I don't want it anymore."
Sami is not here at this moment.
Sami slept at Layla's house.
I don't like to see you this way.
Don't be like your mother, please.
I don't deserve to be treated like a dog.
Sami will pay dearly for what he did.
Mr. Bakir is waiting for me.
I want Sami to be thrown out.
Sami is going to suffer much more.
Sami stayed here without my permission.
Please help me get a taxi.
I'll take you to your house.

We remarked with pain that the indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced (we believe for the first time) at the English court on Friday last ... it is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs and close compressure on the bodies in their dance, to see that it is indeed far removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is attempted to be forced on the respectable classes of society by the civil examples of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.
The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?
Young people are lazy.
The old man complained about young people.
Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline, the haste to know and do all befitting man's estate before its time, the mad rush for sudden wealth and the reckless fashions set by its gilded youth--all these lack some of the regulatives they still have in older lands with more conservative conditions.
A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.
The morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.
It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be.

I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me, And what can be the use of him is more than I can see. He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head; And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.
He hasn't got a notion of how children ought to play, And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way. He stays so close beside me, he's a coward, you can see; I'd think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!
One morning, very early, before the sun was up, I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup; But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head, Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.
The gingham dog and the calico cat Side by side on the table sat.
'Twas half-past twelve, and (what do you think!) Nor one nor t'other had slept a wink!
The old Dutch clock and the Chinese plate Appeared to know as sure as fate There was going to be a terrible spat.
I wasn't there; I simply state What was told to me by the Chinese plate!
The gingham dog went "bow-wow-wow!" And the calico cat replied "mee-ow!
The Chinese plate looked very blue, And wailed, "Oh, dear! what shall we do!"
Next morning where the two had sat They found no trace of the dog or cat; And some folks think unto this day That burglars stole the pair away!
But the truth about the cat and the pup Is this: They ate each other up!
Whatever brawls disturb the street, There should be peace at home: Where sisters dwell and brothers meet, Quarrels should never come.

The boy stood on the burning deck, Whence all but him had fled; The flame that lit the battle's wreck Shone round him o'er the dead.
Yet beautiful and bright he stood, As born to rule the storm; A creature of heroic blood, A proud though childlike form.
He called aloud, "Say, father, say If yet my task is done?" He knew not that the chieftain lay Unconscious of his son.
"Speak, father!" once again he cried, "If I may yet be gone!" And but the booming shots replied, And fast the flames rolled on.
The wreathing fires made way. They wrapt the ship in splendour wild, They caught the flag on high, And streamed above the gallant child Like banners in the sky.
Mary has magical powers.

Then we kissed the little maiden, And we spoke in better cheer, And we anchored safe in harbour When the morn was shining clear.
Vampires don't like sunlight.
Vampires like darkness.
The vampire bit the woman's neck.
Down in a green and shady bed A modest violet grew; Its stalk was bent, it hung its head, As if to hide from view.
And yet it was a lovely flower, No colours bright and fair; It might have graced a rosy bower, Instead of hiding there.
Yet there it was content to bloom; In modest tints arrayed; And there diffused its sweet perfume, Within the silent shade.
Then let me to the valley go, This pretty flower to see; That I may also learn to grow In sweet humility.
My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky; So was it when my life began, So is it now I am a man, So be it when I shall grow old, Or let me die!
The child is father of the man; and I could wish my days to be bound each to each by natural piety.
'TWAS the night before Christmas, when all through the house Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.
The children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads.
And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, Has just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below,The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the luster of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name: "Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky; So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.
He had a broad face and a little round belly, That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head, Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down on a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night."

This house has been gathering dust for who knows how many years.
Once upon a time there were two girls who lived with their mother and father.
Their father had no work, and the girls wanted to go away and seek their fortunes.
So she went on farther into the country, and she came to a place where there was an oven where there was lots of bread baking. And the bread said, "Little girl, little girl, take us out, take us out. We have been baking seven years, and no one has come to take us out."
Then she met a cow, and the cow said, "Little girl, little girl, milk me, milk me! Seven years have I been waiting, and no one has come to milk me."
The girl milked the cow into the pails that stood by.
Then she went on a little bit farther, and came to an apple-tree, so loaded with fruit that its branches were breaking down, and the tree said, "Little girl, little girl, help me shake my fruit. My branches are breaking, it is so heavy." And the girl said, "Of course I will, you poor tree."
Then she went on again till she came to a house. Now in this house there lived a witch, and this witch took girls into her house as servants.
The witch told the girl what work she was to do. "You must keep the house clean and tidy, sweep the floor and the fireplace; but there is one thing you must never do. You must never look up the chimney, or something bad will befall you."
So the girl promised to do as she was told, but one morning as she was cleaning, and the witch was out, she forgot what the witch said, and looked up the chimney.
Apple-tree, apple-tree hide me, So the old witch can't find me; If she does she'll pick my bones, And bury me under the marble stones.
So the baker said, "Look in the oven." The old witch went to look, and the oven said, "Get in and look in the furthest corner." The witch did so, and when she was inside the oven shut her door, and the witch was kept there for a very long time.
The girl then went off again, and reached her home with her money bags, married a rich man, and lived happy ever afterwards.
Do you remember that girl I talked to you about?
Do you remember that guy I talked to you about?
I asked her if she wanted to go out and she said yes.
The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

It is unacceptable that most of the wealth of this great nation is concentrated in the hands of a very wealthy few, while so many others have to work two or even more jobs just to make ends meet. It is high time there was some change in this country.

"Have you been cheating on me?" "Yes, I'm cheating on you, then what?"
Let's feed the monsters.
Something smells nice.
Control your appetite, because if you don't, you would become enormous.
You smell so wonderful.
Did you miss Mommy?
"What's this?" "For you." "Oh, thank you!"
"What's this?" "Some flowers for you."
I have seen what a great job you have been doing with the children.
Nothing much to report.

Sami doesn't even look in Layla's direction.
Sami lived on a boat.
Kiss me again like you did a moment ago.
"Do it again." "What?" "Kiss me again."

This sword endows you with great power.
Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotion know what it means to want to escape from these things.
Don't you see in me reflections of your being?
Poetry is born of pain. Joy is an end in itself.
Poetry is the echo of the melody of the universe in the hearts of humans.
