Where words can be translated into equivalent words, the style of an original can be closely followed; but no translation which aims at being written in normal English can reproduce the style of Aristotle.

The proper translation of the saying is 'Give your child guidance, or they will go astray.' It does not mean 'Beat the shit out of your child or he will become rotten', as many fundamentalist parents seem to believe.

You are not going to welcome the guests.
Tom wanted to turn himself in to the police.
Meeting you is one of the best things that ever happened to me.
It is possible that he came here when he was a child.
The anniversary of the assassination of Itzhak Rabin is a national mourning day.
Tom is wicked, isn't he?
Everywhen I see a little flower lively shining so silently in the grass, I muse on all the mistery, beauty, magic and power lacking in me and that only it has...
Can you really learn a language in a month?
Is this the one you're looking for?

A pool begins with many drops of water.
Global climate change is one of the greatest threats facing humanity.
Accelerating climate change has caused serious impacts. Higher temperatures and extreme weather events are damaging food production, rising sea levels and more damaging storms are putting our coastal cities increasingly at risk and the impacts of climate change are already harming economies around the world, including those of the United States and China. These developments urgently require enhanced actions to tackle the challenge.
Technological innovation is essential for reducing the cost of current mitigation technologies, leading to the invention and dissemination of new zero and low-carbon technologies and enhancing the capacity of countries to reduce their emissions.
Together we can build a fair, effective and common sense immigration system that lives up to our heritage as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
Raising the minimum wage nationwide will increase earnings for millions of workers, and boost the bottom lines of businesses across the country.
The real value of the minimum wage has fallen by nearly one-third since its peak in 1968.
Right now, a full-time minimum wage worker makes $14,500 a year, which leaves too many families struggling to make ends meet.
All major economies must step up to the plate if we are to avoid the dangerous consequences of climate change.
Temperatures from 2001 to 2012 were warmer than any previous decade in every region of the United States.
Globally, the 10 warmest years on record all occurred since 1998.
Shall we eat anything?
For the contiguous 48 states, 7 of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 1998.
2012 was the second most extreme year on record for the nation.
Children, the elderly, and the poor are most vulnerable to a range of climate-related health effects, including those related to heat stress, air pollution, extreme weather events, and diseases carried by food, water, and insects.
Carbon pollution is the biggest driver of climate change.
The global annual average temperature has increased by more than 1.5 degrees F between 1880 and 2012.
Climate scientists say we need to avert an additional 2-degree temperature increase to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
Power plants are the largest major source of emissions in the U.S., together accounting for roughly one-third of all domestic greenhouse gas pollution.
In September 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed carbon pollution standards for new power plants.
During the President's first term, the United States more than doubled generation of electricity from wind and solar energy.
Heavy-duty vehicles (commercial trucks, vans, and buses) are currently the second largest source of greenhouse gas pollution within the transportation sector.
In 2011, the Administration finalized fuel economy standards for Model Year 2014-2018 for heavy-duty trucks, buses, and vans. This will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 270 million metric tons and save 530 million barrels of oil.
The Administration has already established the toughest fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles in U.S. history. These standards require an average performance equivalent of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.
Energy efficiency is one of the clearest and most cost-effective opportunities to save families money, make our businesses more competitive, and reduce greenhouse gas pollution.
In December 2013, the Department of Agriculture announced it will provide up to $250 million to help businesses and residential customers in rural areas cut their energy bills through energy efficiency and renewable energy use.
Since 1990, methane emissions have decreased by 11%.
In March 2014, the Administration released a Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions from landfills, coal mining, agriculture, and oil and gas systems through voluntary actions and common-sense standards.
On December 5 2013, President Obama signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the federal government to buy at least 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2020.
Even as we take new steps to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, we must also prepare for the impacts of a changing climate that are already being felt across the country.
On May 6, 2014, the Administration released the Third U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA), the most authoritative and comprehensive source of scientific information to date about climate change impacts across all U.S. regions and on critical sectors of the economy.
On August 19 2013, the Hurricane Sandy Task Force delivered a rebuilding strategy that is serving as a model for communities across the nation.
In March 2014, the Administration launched the Climate Data Initiative, bringing together extensive open government data and innovation competitions to develop data-driven resilience tools for communities.
The President put forth an initiative to end public financing for new coal-fired power plants overseas, except in rare circumstances.
President Obama has made climate change a key issue in some of our most important bilateral relations, including China and India.
In November 2013, the U.S., Norway, and the U.K. launched a public-private partnership to support forests in developing countries, with the goal of reducing emissions from deforestation and promoting sustainable agriculture.
In April 2014, the U.S., U.K., and Germany announced the Global Innovation Lab for Climate Finance, a public-private platform designed to spur private-sector investment in low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure in developing countries.
Science, accumulated and reviewed over decades, tells us that our planet is changing in ways that will have profound impacts on all of humankind.
The high-density urban coastal corridor from Washington, DC, north to Boston is one of the most developed environments in the world, containing a massive, complex, and long-standing network of supporting infrastructure. The Northeast also has a vital rural component.
The Southeast and Caribbean region is home to more than 80 million people and some of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas.
The Gulf and Atlantic coasts are major producers of seafood and home to seven major ports.
The Southeast is a major energy producer of coal, crude oil, and natural gas.
The Great Plains region experiences multiple climate and weather hazards, including floods, droughts, severe storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and winter storms. In much of the Great Plains, too little precipitation falls to replace that needed by humans, plants, and animals. These variable conditions already stress communities and cause billions of dollars in damage. Climate change will add to both stress and costs.
The Southwest is the hottest and driest region in the United States. Climate changes pose challenges for an already parched region that is expected to get hotter and, in its southern half, significantly drier. Increased heat and changes to rain and snowpack will send ripple effects throughout the region and its critical agriculture sector.
The U.S. Pacific Islands region includes more than 2,000 islands spanning millions of square miles of ocean. Rising air and ocean temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, changing frequencies and intensities of storms and drought, decreasing streamflows, rising sea levels, and changing ocean chemistry will threaten the sustainability of globally important and diverse ecosystems as well as local communities, livelihoods, and cultures.
Climate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways, including through impacts from increased extreme weather events, wildfire, decreased air quality, threats to mental health, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease carriers such as mosquitoes and ticks. Some of these health impacts are already underway in the United States.
The impacts from sea level rise and storm surge, extreme weather events, higher temperatures and heat waves, precipitation changes, Arctic warming, and other climatic conditions are affecting the reliability and capacity of the U.S. transportation system in many ways.
Extreme weather events currently disrupt transportation networks in all areas of the country; projections indicate that such disruptions will increase.
Sea level rise, coupled with storm surge, will continue to increase the risk of major coastal impacts on transportation infrastructure, including both temporary and permanent flooding of airports, ports and harbors, roads, rail lines, tunnels, and bridges.
Extreme weather events are affecting energy production and delivery facilities, causing supply disruptions of varying lengths and magnitudes and affecting other infrastructure that depends on energy supply.
Higher summer temperatures will increase electricity use, causing higher summer peak loads, while warmer winters will decrease energy demands for heating.
Changes in water availability, both episodic and long-lasting, will constrain different forms of energy production.
In the longer term, sea level rise, extreme storm surge events, and high tides will affect coastal facilities and infrastructure on which many energy systems, markets, and consumers depend. As new investments in energy technologies occur, future energy systems will differ from today's in uncertain ways.
Climate change affects water demand and the ways water is used within and across regions and economic sectors.
The Southwest, Great Plains, and Southeast are particularly vulnerable to changes in water supply and demand. Changes in precipitation and runoff, combined with changes in consumption and withdrawal, have reduced surface and groundwater supplies in many areas. These trends are expected to continue, increasing the likelihood of water shortages for many uses.
Increasing flooding risk affects human safety and health, property, infrastructure, economies, and ecology in many basins across the United States.
Climate disruptions to agriculture have been increasing and are projected to become more severe over this century.
Some areas are already experiencing climate-related disruptions, particularly due to extreme weather events.
While some U.S. regions and some types of agricultural production will be relatively resilient to climate change over the next 25 years or so, others will increasingly suffer from stresses due to extreme heat, drought, disease, and heavy downpours.
Climate change effects on agriculture will have consequences for food security, both in the U.S. and globally, through changes in crop yields and food prices and effects on food processing, storage, transportation, and retailing.
Ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society are being affected by climate change.
The capacity of ecosystems to buffer the impacts of extreme events like fires, floods, and severe storms is being overwhelmed.
Climate change impacts on biodiversity are already being observed in alteration of the timing of critical biological events such as spring bud burst, and substantial range shifts of many species. In the longer term, there is an increased risk of species extinction.
He said that English was his maternal language, but his accent was a dead giveaway.
Events such as droughts, floods, wildfires, and pest outbreaks associated with climate change (for example, bark beetles in the West) are already disrupting ecosystems.
Ocean waters are becoming warmer and more acidic, broadly affecting ocean circulation, chemistry, ecosystems, and marine life. More acidic waters inhibit the formation of shells, skeletons, and coral reefs.
Warmer waters harm coral reefs and alter the distribution, abundance, and productivity of many marine species.
The rising temperature and changing chemistry of ocean water combine with other stresses, such as overfishing and coastal and marine pollution, to alter marine-based food production and harm fishing communities.
Temperatures in the United States are expected to continue to rise.
Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.
Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, especially in the West.
Cold waves have become less frequent and intense across the Nation.
Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.
The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s.
Winter storms have increased in frequency and intensity since the 1950s, and their tracks have shifted northward over the United States.
Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases.
More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.
Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades.
Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.
The length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.
Rising temperatures are reducing ice volume and surface extent on land, lakes, and sea. This loss of ice is expected to continue.
The Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century.
Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100.
The oceans are currently absorbing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually and are becoming more acidic as a result, leading to concerns about intensifying impacts on marine ecosystems.
Climate change will, absent other changes, amplify some of the existing health threats the Nation now faces. Certain people and communities are especially vulnerable, including children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color.
Because the refrigerator door had remained open, much of the food spoiled.

The brave halfling stumbled from a frying pan straight into a fire.
The President is directing federal agencies to develop a comprehensive program aimed at deterring illegal fishing, addressing seafood fraud, and preventing illegally caught fish from entering the marketplace by increasing traceability and transparency.
The Administration is also taking steps to protect coastal communities from the impacts of climate change, improve domestic aquaculture, and provide research to better understand the challenges facing our oceans.
Up to 20% of the world's seafood is caught illegally.
On April 7, President Obama announced more than $100 million in grants to support high school models that better prepare students for college and the careers of the future.

Businesses have created more than 9.7 million private sector jobs in the past 52 months.
American manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs since January 2012, the strongest period of job growth since 1989.
To prepare Americans for the jobs of the future and help restore middle-class security, we have to out-educate the world and that starts with a strong school system.
Educating every American student to graduate from high school prepared for college and for a career is a national imperative.
Earning a post-secondary degree or credential is a prerequisite for 21st century jobs, and one that everyone should be able to afford.
Higher education is not a luxury.
We need great educators to teach our children the math and science skills that will enable them to compete for jobs in the future.
On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, putting in place comprehensive reforms that improve access to affordable health coverage for everyone and protect consumers from abusive insurance company practices.
Technology has the potential to transform education in America, allowing students to learn more, to do so at their own pace, and to develop the knowledge and skills employers demand.
The President has called for a comprehensive effort to rethink the high school experience.
A child born into the bottom 20% of the income scale has a less than 1-in-20 shot of making it to the top if they do not go to college. Earning a college degree changes those odds to closer to 1-in-5.
Higher education is the single most important investment students can make in their own futures. At the same time, students are taking on increasing amounts of debt to pay for it.

The President will also continue to urge Congress to raise the minimum wage to $10.10 across the nation because no one who works full-time should have to raise their family in poverty.
The President has directed his Administration to work to cut carbon pollution through clean energy and energy efficiency.
This year, the Administration will announce the winners of a $100 million competition supporting redesigned high schools that give high school students access to real-world education and skills.
A higher minimum wage can raise earnings and reduce poverty.
More businesses, from small businesses to large corporations, see higher wages as the right way to boost productivity, reduce turnover and increase profits.
Starting to save is the first step towards a secure retirement.
Workers must have a place to invest their hard-earned savings that provides an appropriate balance of risk and return, and many private sector providers do not offer retirement savings options tailored to smaller balance savers.
At a time when we as a nation should be moving forward in our efforts to help those who are long-term unemployed find new jobs, we should never have taken a step backwards by abruptly cutting off their unemployment insurance.
About half of all American workers do not have access to workplace retirement savings plan.
The President reiterated his call for Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and give women more tools to fight pay discrimination.
When women succeed, America succeeds.
Today, federal law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, sex, religion, and disability.
Insurance companies can no longer deny coverage to children because of a pre-existing condition like asthma and diabetes, providing peace of mind for parents of the more than 17.6 million children with pre-existing conditions. Starting in 2014, no American can be discriminated against due to a pre-existing condition.
In the past, some people with cancer or other chronic illnesses ran out of insurance coverage because their health care expenses reached a dollar limit imposed by their insurance company. Under the health care law, insurers can no longer impose lifetime dollar limits on essential health benefits and annual limits are being phased out by 2014.
Insurance companies can no longer drop your coverage when you get sick due to a mistake you made on your application.
Insurers are now required to cover a number of recommended preventive services, such as cancer, diabetes and blood pressure screenings, without additional cost sharing such as copays or deductibles.
Before the law, many Americans with pre-existing conditions were locked or priced out of the health insurance market. More than 50,000 Americans with pre-existing conditions have gained coverage through the new Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan.
Nearly 50 million older Americans and Americans with disabilities rely on Medicare each year.
On August 3, 2010, President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act, which reduces the disparity in the amounts of powder cocaine and crack cocaine required to trigger certain penalties in the federal system, including imposition of mandatory minimum sentences.

My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration.
Government should be transparent.
Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about what their Government is doing.
My Administration will take appropriate action, consistent with law and policy, to disclose information rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and use.
Executive departments and agencies should harness new technologies to put information about their operations and decisions online and readily available to the public.
Government should be participatory.
Public engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions.
Executive departments and agencies should offer Americans increased opportunities to participate in policymaking and to provide their Government with the benefits of their collective expertise and information.
Executive departments and agencies should solicit public input on how we can increase and improve opportunities for public participation in Government.
Government should be collaborative.
Executive departments and agencies should use innovative tools, methods, and systems to cooperate among themselves, across all levels of Government, and with nonprofit organizations, businesses, and individuals in the private sector.
Executive departments and agencies should solicit public feedback to assess and improve their level of collaboration and to identify new opportunities for cooperation.
This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.
This memorandum shall be published in the Federal Register.
A democracy requires accountability, and accountability requires transparency.
As Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, "sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants."
In our democracy, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which encourages accountability through transparency, is the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring an open Government.
Accountability is in the interest of the Government and the citizenry alike.
The Freedom of Information Act should be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.
The Government should not keep information confidential merely because public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.
Nondisclosure should never be based on an effort to protect the personal interests of Government officials at the expense of those they are supposed to serve.
In responding to requests under the FOIA, executive branch agencies should act promptly and in a spirit of cooperation, recognizing that such agencies are servants of the public.
All agencies should adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure, in order to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA, and to usher in a new era of open Government.
Agencies should take affirmative steps to make information public. They should not wait for specific requests from the public.
All agencies should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government.
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy advises the President about the effects of science and technology on domestic and international affairs.
Transparency in government is a key component of a democracy. Ensuring that the public has access to government information both builds public trust in government decision-making and allows the public to hold government accountable for those decisions.
Thousands of major government data resources have been posted in "machine-readable" form for free public access on the Data.gov website, and range from weather data to car safety ratings to the cost of healthcare procedures.

Someone had definitely spiked Tom's drink, because he could no longer stand up and the next morning he could remember nothing.
This type of discrimination isn't very widespread in our country.
After the earthquake the neighbourhood felt insecure.
Customs officials carried out a full body search on Tom.
There is no doubt that Marley was dead.
Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley.
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, nor wintry weather chill him.
You don't talk a lot.
"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" cried a cheerful voice.
"Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!"
You don't mean that, I am sure.
You don't mean that, I'm sure.
Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry?
Every idiot who goes about with 'Merry Christmas,' on his lips, should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
Stay where you are!
Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us tomorrow.
"Why did you get married?" said Scrooge. "Because I fell in love." "Because you fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas.
I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be friends?
Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?
He died seven years ago, this very night.
It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!
The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound.
Why do you doubt your senses?
Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes.
The spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones.
Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?
"Hear me!" cried the Ghost. "My time is nearly gone."
You were always a good friend to me.
"You will be haunted," resumed the Ghost, "by Three Spirits."
The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went.
When Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber.
Was it a dream or not?
"Who, and what are you?" Scrooge demanded. "I am the Ghost of Christmas Past."
Marley was dead: to begin with.
"These are but shadows of the things that have been," said the Ghost. "They have no consciousness of us."
"The school is not quite deserted," said the Ghost. "A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still."
A lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire.
"What is the matter?" asked the Spirit. "Nothing," said Scrooge. "Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that's all."
The door opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her "Dear, dear brother."
May you be happy in the life you have chosen!
Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl.
The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count.
There is no doubt whatever about that.
They were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty.
I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon.
"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present," said the Spirit. "Look upon me!"
A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!
Scrooge was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full five minutes.
They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another, and contented with the time; and when they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.
He lives on the floor above mine.
This museum is one of the world's largest art museums.
He just told me.

This is a fantastic idea.
It's too hard for me.
Here are my grandmother's dentures.
A group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour's house.
The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song.
"Ha, ha!" laughed Scrooge's nephew. "Ha, ha, ha!"
If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.
Tom works for a large financial institution.

"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner," said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.
Burn not your house to fright the mouse away.
I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!
The Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached.
"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?" said Scrooge.
"When did he die?" "Last night, I believe."
A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone.
To whom will our debt be transferred?
We may sleep tonight with light hearts, Caroline!
Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead. But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change.
Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge.
At the ominous word "liberality", Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back.
I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.
I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a school-boy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world.
"What's today?" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him. "Eh?" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder. "What's today, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge. "Today!" replied the boy. "Why, Christmas Day."
Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that was hanging up there? Not the little prize Turkey: the big one?
Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are at it.
Wash your face with warm water and soap.
Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!
"A merry Christmas, Bob!" said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back.
I'll raise your salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon.
See you tomorrow then!

Clearly, the Time Traveller proceeded, any real body must have extension in four directions: it must have Length, Breadth, Thickness, and Duration.
There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time.
For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, three-dimensional representations of his four-dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing.
If Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?
She is speaking to herself.
Tom held Mary tight against his chest and whispered "I love you" into her hair.
Time doesn't change us, it reveals what we are.
There is a bird here.
Are you sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.
We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave.
You can move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.
You are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time.
'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you will never convince me.'
The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance.
The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp.
It's beautifully made.
It took two years to make.
She gave it to me.
Everyone was silent for a minute.
Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?
He didn't give it to me.

Save me some of that mutton. I'm starving for a bit of meat.
Interlingue is an easy and beautiful language.
"Story be damned!" said the Time Traveller. "I want something to eat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And the salt."
'Have you been time travelling?' 'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head.
The journalist tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter.
The Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp.
The silent man seemed even more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of sheer nervousness.
He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end.
I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant.
There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears.
I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones.

The type of mastectomy a patient undergoes depends on numerous factors, including whether the patient intends undergoing reconstructive surgery.
In some cases, mastectomy is prophylactic surgery - a preventive measure taken by those considered to be at high risk of breast cancer.
In comparison to mastectomy, lumpectomy removes a smaller percentage of breast tissue.
A bilateral salpingectomy, which is the surgical removal of both Fallopian tubes, will result in sterility.
An ectopic pregnancy is dangerous and potentially fatal for the mother.
While most ectopic pregnancies occur in the Fallopian tube, it is also possible for them to occur in the ovaries, abdomen, or cervix.
Tom has a thick skin.

She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always.
"They must have been ghosts," I said.
A queer notion of Grant Allen's came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them.
There is a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental purposes of civilization.
My explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one.
The next night, I did not sleep well.
If each generation die and leave ghosts the world at last will get overcrowded with them.

They're competing against each other for the job.
Tom is just right for the job.
I'm the one who has the job.
I don't think you did a very thorough job.
Tom is the only one here with a real job.
I think you've done a wonderful job.
That's part of our job.
Tom is going to have your job.
I suggest you get back in there and do your job.
I'm trying to help you keep your job.
Tom could be after your job.
That's why I can't take this job.
You've done a brilliant job.
I'm sure this won't cost me my job.
I have to quit my job.
Tom is a whackjob.
Tom fumbled with the doorknob.
Tom is the manager of the club.
We don't want people like Tom in our club.
Help me get Tom into the bathtub.
Let's just take a sec.
There could be traffic.
I'm going to need you to be more specific.
There's no such thing as black magic.
Tom was laughed at in public.
I can't believe Tom did that in public.
It's too public.
Most of Tom's friends know that he's a recovering alcoholic.
Tom knows that Mary is a recovering alcoholic.
I'm only the mechanic.
Tom couldn't help feeling a twinge of panic.
Stay away from the clinic.
Make it a gin and tonic.
Tom is swaying slightly with the music.
Tom cranked up the music.
There was no music.
That's very dramatic.
Tom tends to be overdramatic.
You were always the romantic.
What Tom did was unbelievably idiotic.
Tom wrapped the sandwich in plastic.
I must do something drastic.
I couldn't tell what had happened, but it looked bad.
It'd be bad.
Not all aliens are bad.
You know, this isn't half bad.
I want a drink real bad.
I've been real bad.
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
Tom wants it so bad.
You're not so bad.
Sharing a bathroom's not so bad.
It's really not so bad.
Tom was hurt bad.
Tom is hurt bad.
That sounds really bad.
That sounds pretty bad.
They were found dead.
The only problem is that Tom may already be dead.
Tom is probably the only person in the world who cares if I'm alive or dead.
Tom is listed as dead.
We're as good as dead.
Now I wish I was dead.
The guard is dead.
I just can't believe Tom is dead.
I'm telling you that we have to assume that Tom is dead.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Tom is dead.
The line went dead.
Don't put ideas in Tom's head.
Tom was just talking off the top of his head.
Tom has a price on his head.
Tom pressed an ice pack to his head.
Tom completely lost his head.
I wish I could get it out of my head.
I've called ahead.
You really should've phoned ahead.
I really haven't thought that far ahead.
Tom came out ahead.
Tom is a real hothead.
Tom began to read.
I don't know what I had.
I like to think of Tom as the brother I never had.
Tom is the little brother I never had.
Tom is like the big brother I never had.
You can't lose what you never had.
I've got boxes to unload.
Tom slowed down and pulled over to the side of the road.
I really need to get back on the road.
We saw your truck on the road.
You're all over the road.
Tom didn't know whether to be happy or sad.
It seemed very odd.
Tom is lying face down on the bed.
Tom's suitcase is on the bed.
Tom is lying in a hospital bed.
Tom is lying in the hospital bed.
Tom sat up in bed.
Tom was in bed.
Read Tom a story and put him to bed.
I'm putting the boy to bed.
Tom is lying fully dressed on his bed.
Tom is lying motionless on his bed.
Tom felt snubbed.
I don't believe that you're mentally unbalanced.
I don't know what I experienced.
Tom was easily influenced.
I don't like where this is headed.
The carts were being loaded.
Tom smiled and nodded.
They succeeded.
Tom's fate is already decided.
I know Tom wouldn't leave me stranded.
You come highly recommended.
Tom was dumbfounded.
You're completely surrounded.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
The prison is heavily guarded.
They all applauded.
Tips aren't included.
Tom was very specific that you be excluded.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I intruded.
I believe we'll be able to succeed.
Tom didn't succeed.
This is serious indeed.
You've got mouths to feed.
I just can't get the information I need.
That'll give us the focus we need.
I'm here for you in your time of need.
That's all the warning Tom and the others need.
I hope you get the information you need.
They might have what you need.
They might sell what you need.
I can be exactly what you need.
Tom kept me up to speed.
The car started to pick up speed.
I've been fully briefed.
Tom scoffed.
I'm encouraged.
Tom wasn't discouraged.
I don't want to get upstaged.
You should assume that your phone is bugged.
Tom casually shrugged.
That's when everything changed.
Tom's appearance has changed.
One thing hasn't changed.
Tom knows the game just changed.
Blows were exchanged.
You will be charged.
Tom's arms ached.
It's not so far-fetched.
Tom looked up and laughed.
Tom never laughed.
The girls laughed.
Tom isn't the sharpest tool in the shed.
Tom was genuinely astonished.
I have to be punished.
I've been adequately punished.
The room became slightly hushed.
Tom looks a little flushed.
Tom mistakenly informed everyone that I had died.
It's been almost three years since Tom died.
Let's go over what happened the day Tom died.
You very nearly died.
I assume you're qualified.
Tom is sick, weak and terrified.
Tom didn't know whether to be amused or horrified.
I'm not convinced that's justified.
Tom was by no means satisfied.
Tom was perfectly satisfied.
Well, I lied.
I always thought you and Tom were married.
You certainly knew Tom was married.
That, Tom, is why we never got married.
Please tell me you're not married.
Tom isn't in the least worried.
Believe me, I've tried.
When I saw what happened to Tom, I freaked.
My bag's always packed.
The baby just kicked.
The clock ticked.
The crowd looked shocked.
The jury looked shocked.
We're all deeply shocked.
Tom tried the basement door and to his surprise, it was unlocked.
Tom also talked.
It's time you two talked.
I told you I didn't like the way Tom looked.
Nothing has been overlooked.
Not all cops are crooked.
You sound terribly overworked.
That isn't what I asked.
I've done as you've asked.
We're ready to do exactly as you've asked.
The truth couldn't be concealed.
Tom's wounds have healed.
Tom's birth records are sealed.
The leak has been sealed.
Tom picked up the phone and dialed.
Tom should've been court-martialed.
Tom's face paled.
Tom is deeply troubled.
The game got canceled.
Tom's clothes are disheveled.
Tom's hair is disheveled.
Tom was baffled.
Tom leaned back and smiled.
Tom sat back and smiled.
Tom looked at his cards and smiled.
Tom seldom smiled.
Tom also smiled.
Tom's eyes twinkled.
Tom's eyes sparkled.
Please forget I called.
Tom stopped when he heard his name being called.
You know, I'm actually glad Tom called.
Tom tried to have me killed.
That may be what got Tom killed.
My husband was killed.
They know you were the one who visited Tom the night before he was killed.
You were in this room with Tom when he was killed.
I could have you killed.
That big mouth of yours is going to get you killed.
Tom tried to have Mary killed.
I've never been so thrilled.
You sure had me fooled.
It's been dismantled.
Tom was disgruntled.
Tom was a little startled.
Tom whistled.
You've got me all rattled.
I know what got Tom rattled.
That's what had me puzzled.
Tom was completely puzzled.
Every time something unusual happens, I get blamed.
You're all doomed.
I don't think you should be alarmed.
Tom was alarmed.
Tom wasn't a bit alarmed.
Tell them we're unarmed.
Tom's doubts have been confirmed.
Tom is amazingly well informed.
I don't need my carpet cleaned.
Tom stiffened.
The kitchen door opened.
Tom sat back down as if nothing had happened.
It's like nothing ever happened.
Let's forget last night ever happened.
It's as though the incident never happened.
Let's all just sit down and try to talk about what's happened.
We're awfully sorry about what's happened.
In a sense, that's exactly what's happened.
Tom is still not fully aware of what has happened.
I must know precisely what has happened.
A lot has happened.
Things happened.
But that's not all that happened.
Let's see what happened.
It doesn't change what happened.
That's the true account of what happened.
Even though we followed the stupid rules, look what happened.
Please don't ask Tom what happened.
Don't hold yourself responsible for what happened.
So what if that's what happened.
We need for you to tell us what happened.
It's the only way we'll find out what happened.
It's been pretty bad around here since it happened.
We talked about this when it happened.
Tom tried to make sense of what just happened.
Tom's eyes softened.
I'm so frightened.
I don't think I've ever been so frightened.
Tom was very frightened.
Tom quietly listened.
I've just been reassigned.
Tom's patience is being strained.
Tom has been unavoidably detained.
I should've declined.
I need to have my head examined.
Tom was ruined.
I have something very special planned.
Tell me what Tom has planned.
Tom was mentioned.
The pigeons were all poisoned.
You've been forewarned.
We have no problem as far as the house is concerned.
Tom left home with everything he owned.
I'm stumped.
Tom stood up and clapped.
The charge was dropped.
I just know Tom has to be stopped.
Boy is my face red.
No one would've cared.
Tom was good and scared.
It's as I feared.
The mist cleared.
It's a good thing I came prepared.
No expense was spared.
I can't believe you remembered.
Your days are numbered.
Tom shuddered.
Tom appeared to be bewildered.
Tom's attention wandered.
Tom's daughter was murdered.
Tom sneered.
I can tell that you've suffered.
Tom staggered.
Tom snickered.
Tom stammered.
Tom isn't so well-mannered.
Tom shivered.
It's been delivered.
We just want to have a few questions answered.
Tom knocked and Mary answered.
Tom didn't deserve to be fired.
I think I'm about to get fired.
My arms are tired.
Tom will eventually get tired.
Tom is now looking very tired.
Tom was suddenly very tired.
I hate being bored.
Tom was just getting bored.
I'm so bored.
Tom and Mary stared at each other with hatred.
It's a good thing you're insured.
Tom seemed reassured.
Tom felt reassured.
Tom is being tortured.
No one will be released.
Tom will be so pleased.
You must be very pleased.
Tom wasn't displeased.
That's what I promised.
Tom compromised.
I don't mind telling you I'm surprised.
You're very patient, so why are you being so unreasonable about waiting ten more minutes?
I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.
Tom's face was swollen and bruised.
Tom's ego has been bruised.
Tom isn't licensed.
The door was still closed.
Tom's office said he was indisposed.
You're in danger of being exposed.
I can't help being a little embarrassed.
I lied because I was embarrassed.
Tom was evidently embarrassed.
Tom was just helping me get dressed.
Tom is almost fully dressed.
I'm so depressed.
Tom was very depressed.
The group was impressed.
Tom was deeply impressed.
I've seen your resume and am very impressed.
Tom looks distressed.
Our paths have crossed.
Tom was a little confused.
Tom became confused.
I always get those two names confused.
Tom is now genuinely confused.
Tom's imagination was aroused.
Tom's situation is getting more complicated.
I'm not that easily intimidated.
I know how I'm supposed to be treated.
The report may be exaggerated.
You're about to be exonerated.
I hope you're well compensated.
Tom was irritated.
Tom might not even be infected.
You don't want it to get infected.
Tom objected.
I'd like to go over the information you've collected.
I know Tom is connected.
It was just as you suspected.
Tom's very different from what I expected.
You aren't what I expected.
It was to be expected.
I know it's a little unexpected.
Tom is freaking out, just like Mary predicted.
Tom is in danger of being evicted.
You will remain silent until further instructed.
Tom was delighted.
Tom was disappointed at not being invited.
Tom takes everything for granted.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
They were discontented.
I don't believe you two are acquainted.
I'll let you two get acquainted.
Tom ran off in the direction that Mary pointed.
Tom couldn't help but look disappointed.
Tom said that the house was haunted.
Tell me you were adopted.
Please tell me I'm adopted.
I always knew I was adopted.
Tom wasn't very happy at being interrupted.
You're so kind-hearted.
Tom began to get downhearted.
Tom is never going to finish the job he started.
Now look what you've started.
Tom is just helping me get started.
Now if you don't mind, I'd like to get started.
The office was deserted.
The office is deserted.
I'm so wasted.
For the record, I'm not at all interested.
If it has something to do with Tom, I'm interested.
I get why you're so interested.
I don't think I'd be that interested.
Tom wasn't a bit interested.
Whatever it is, we're not interested.
Whatever you're selling, I'm not interested.
It's not that I'm not interested.
For the record, I'm not remotely interested.
Tom was momentarily interested.
You should have Tom arrested.
We should have you arrested.
I'm going to have you arrested.
Tom protested.
You knew what you were getting into when you enlisted.
Tom never even knew I existed.
I'm seeing a side of you I never knew existed.
Tom's patience was exhausted.
I knew you weren't to be trusted.
I knew that Tom wasn't to be trusted.
You've exceeded the time allotted.
I don't think we were spotted.
I don't wish to be rescued.
We all want to be rescued.
Tom looked pale and fatigued.
The static continued.
Some people just can't be saved.
You must be deeply relieved.
Life needs to be lived.
Tom booked a room for me at a hotel near where he lived.
You guys are all sleep deprived.
Tom has been a nervous wreck ever since we arrived.
Tom arrived.
I've been watching you since you arrived.
I don't see how they could've survived.
Tom could've survived.
It's a miracle you survived.
I just want the situation resolved.
I don't see how Tom would be involved.
I know Tom is involved.
Tom isn't sure he wants to get involved.
Sorry, Tom, I didn't want to get you involved.
Besides, I didn't want to get you involved.
Tom says I'm too personally involved.
I've never felt so loved.
Tom and Mary never moved.
Tom bowed.
You never showed.
That can't be allowed.
Tom followed.
I thought you said it was getting fixed.
Tom was overjoyed.
Tom was extremely annoyed.
It's been destroyed.
You just need to be organized.
Tom thought Mary would die an old maid.
I hope you're well paid.
I always thought I'd be afraid.
I'm so afraid.
Tell me you're not afraid.
Tom was terribly afraid.
That's what the papers said.
Tom can't have understood what you said.
We had to do as they said.
We had to do what they said.
Tom confirmed what Mary said.
Tom was irked by what Mary said.
Tom was totally blown away by what Mary said.
Tom's going to kill me when he finds out what I did.
I don't know why I reacted the way I did.
Tom let Mary take credit for what he did.
I'm not ashamed of what we did.
It's a good thing you came to me when you did.
You never said what you did.
Tom was mugged as a kid.
This is no place for a three-year-old kid.
You're a weird kid.
Tom is just a mixed-up kid.
Tom is a perfectly normal, perfectly healthy kid.
Tom lifted the lid.
I always suspected that Tom was a little paranoid.
I'm not being paranoid.
I don't know what's worse: being stupid or pretending to be stupid.
I suppose I'm just being stupid.
Love isn't blind, but it's often stupid.
You know the trouble with you, Tom, you're just stupid.
That's unbelievably stupid.
It's actually incredibly stupid.
Tom is an authority in his field.
Tom is hardly a child.
I must be getting old.
I guess we're getting old.
I suddenly felt old.
I really don't feel the cold.
I'm so cold.
Brr, it's cold.
Tom suddenly felt cold.
Tom is still out cold.
The water was icy cold.
Tom was very cold.
Tom removed Mary's blindfold.
I don't think this weather will hold.
Tom is on hold.
I'm putting you on hold.
Tom wanted to carry Mary over the threshold.
We're at peace with the world.
Tom isn't the brightest guy in the world.
You're the most important woman in the whole world.
Hey, welcome to the real world.
Tom did what he could.
I want to introduce you to my new husband.
I didn't want to dismiss it out of hand.
Tom knocked the drink out of Mary's hand.
Tom's sword was knocked from his hand.
Tom held up his hand.
Tom tried to focus on the task at hand.
Let's try to stay focused on the problem at hand.
There must be someone else living on the island.
Tom put me in command.
Fire on my command.
Tom is lying face down in the sand.
Tom could talk his way out of quicksand.
Tom has been batting a thousand.
That's where I stand.
I don't know if you'd understand.
None of them could understand.
I thought you, of all people, would understand.
You have to make them understand.
Tom seemed to understand.
Tom's attitude is quite simple to understand.
I think I'm starting to understand.
I'm just trying to get you to understand.
This road is a dead end.
I've always known how this would end.
I knew they'd get me in the end.
I can't believe this is going to end.
I know how this is going to end.
We want that to end.
I can make you a legend.
I know more than you could possibly comprehend.
It looks like you could use a friend.
We were traveling with a friend.
I'm here tonight as a friend.
I'm reaching out to you as a friend.
I said Tom is a friend.
I'm going out to dinner with an old friend.
I can be your best friend.
I was ratted out by my best friend.
I thought Tom would be perfect for my friend.
I'm almost glad I don't have a girlfriend.
I talked to Tom's old girlfriend.
You're the perfect girlfriend.
You're the perfect boyfriend.
Tom is going to give me a haircut this weekend.
It's a special blend.
I'll let you know what I find.
That's the only one I could find.
I just threw on whatever I could find.
Don't go looking for something you don't want to find.
Tom snuck up on me from behind.
This is the good kind.
I'm not trying to imply anything of the kind.
It looks like a camera of some kind.
I know your kind.
Tom walked over to the window and pulled up the blind.
Try to have an open mind.
Put it out of your mind.
I suggest you put it out of your mind.
I think you've lost your mind.
I'm asking you to help me change Tom's mind.
Tom is clearly out of his mind.
Tom has a brilliant mind.
Tom never even entered my mind.
I haven't lost my mind.
You've got a dirty mind.
Tom is a mastermind.
Tom wasn't fooled for a second.
I'm not buying it for a second.
I'd like to slow things down for just a second.
I need you for just a second.
I have to watch them every second.
Tom has a very substantial retirement fund.
I told you I wasn't interested in a refund.
They were nowhere to be found.
Tom is nowhere to be found.
You left the bar last night just when I was about to buy everyone another round.
I glanced around.
Tom paused for a moment and looked around.
Tom is hard to be around.
Tom needs to turn his life around.
I usually don't allow people to boss me around.
I knew you'd come around.
Tom has been looking around.
Quit screwing around.
We were just screwing around.
I quite like having Tom around.
I didn't tell you to turn around.
What goes around, comes around.
Well, I'll see you around.
Tom loves having Mary around.
Tom stomped on the ground.
Please put your weapon on the ground.
Tom's gun is on the ground.
Tom looked at the ground.
It's good to see you safe and sound.
There was no sound.
I felt like God.
I didn't want to play God.
I don't like alcohol, period.
One of Tom's complaints is the food.
We'll grow more food.
It's a waste of food.
Tom walked in with bags of take-out food.
It'd be good.
That'd be good.
This ought to be good.
It's a chance for all of us to do something good.
That won't do us much good.
It'd look good.
Let's make this look good.
I have to say you look good.
That sandwich really does smell good.
You know too much for your own good.
This is for your own good.
That was no good.
Tom isn't looking too good.
That wouldn't look so good.
It feels so good.
That feels so good.
That massage felt so good.
I do believe it's for the greater good.
Tom's appetite was good.
Tom's reputation is good.
I think ambition is good.
I don't remember you looking this good.
I do think this isn't good.
I'm afraid the prognosis isn't good.
I don't feel that good.
They aren't that good.
A little exercise would do you good.
It would do you good.
Tom was really good.
That sounds really good.
That would be very good.
It doesn't look very good.
Tom is looking pretty good.
I've been pretty good.
That sounds pretty good.
There goes the neighborhood.
Tom is my flesh and blood.
I think you've lost too much blood.
Somebody's in a good mood.
I'm really not in the mood.
I wish I understood.
Tom maxed out his credit card.
Tom had to shout to be heard.
I couldn't make myself heard.
That was the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
You look positively haggard.
That shouldn't be hard.
Tom is trying real hard.
I think you're taking this a little too hard.
Tom picked up the black knight and moved it across the board.
Let's not go overboard.
Tom pressed a key on the computer keyboard.
Tom is under 24-hour guard.
Tom is bound to be on his guard.
I've asked Tom to assign you a bodyguard.
The problem is all parents wants their children to go to Harvard.
Let's give Tom his reward.
It's kind of awkward.
It's a bit awkward.
They branded you a coward.
I leaned forward.
It sounds pretty straightforward.
Tom let the dog loose in the yard.
That's a little weird.
It feels weird.
Tell me this isn't weird.
This is off the record.
I have a juvenile record.
Tom has no prison record.
I eat what I can afford.
I won't breathe a word.
I didn't listen to a word.
Don't you say a word.
You said the magic word.
I'll spread the word.
We'll spread the word.
Don't fire until I give the word.
You need only give the word.
I just got the word.
I'll take Tom at his word.
Tom unsheathed his sword.
Tom lowered his sword.
Tom is currently in prison for tax fraud.
Tom pulled Mary out of the mud.
Tom laughed aloud.
Tom chuckled aloud.
I'd like Tom to read what's written on that paper aloud.
I'm so proud.
Tom pushed through the crowd.
Tom emerged from the crowd.
Tom quickly disappeared in the crowd.
I don't see who else it could be.
That's as it should be.
I can predict how what Tom's answer will be.
I know how overwhelming it can be.
I forgot just how clever you can be.
Tom knows this is how it has to be.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him in peace.
I'm just someone who wants peace.
I'm going to punch you in the face.
You should've seen your face.
You've got food on your face.
You should've seen the look on your face.
Cookie licked Tom's face.
The hint of a smile appeared on Tom's face.
Tom saw the surprise on Mary's face.
Tom looked up into Mary's face.
Tom unwrapped the scarf from his around his face.
Tom finished drying his face.
Tom had a slight smile on his face.
I knew I recognized that face.
I knew you weren't just a pretty face.
I'd hate to see anything happen to your pretty face.
We're going to get you to a safe place.
Tom, this is neither the time nor the place.
My jeans ripped at the seams.
Tom looks out of place.
I have more than one hiding place.
I'll meet Tom at the usual place.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
Tom, please, this isn't the time or place.
Tom has definitely been put in his place.
We'll leave this place.
I don't think I can survive in this place.
I have a weird feeling about this place.
Tom should've told Mary the truth in the first place.
I sent Tom to Boston in my place.
Tom stashed some stuff at my place.
Tom and Mary were walking at a brisk pace.
Tom isn't even in the race.
I just want to get through this in one piece.
Tom leaned against the mantelpiece.
I gave at the office.
I just got the word that Tom will be moving to our Boston office.
There's pay phone in the hall outside Tom's office.
There's a pile of cash on the floor in the middle of Tom's office.
Tom showed Mary into John's office.
I don't have a couch in my office.
I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
Tom, Mary and John are gathered around Alice.
Tom was running from the police.
I'm going to report you to the police.
I'm not the police.
Tom has been detained by the police.
That'd be nice.
I can be nice.
That might be nice.
I think you're just being nice.
It felt nice.
You had to make a choice.
Tom made it sound like I have a choice.
You say that like I have a choice.
I don't see that there's a choice.
I don't see it as a choice.
I don't see that we have much choice.
It's the logical choice.
Tom clearly has no choice.
That leaves us no choice.
Tom will have no other choice.
Tom was left with no other choice.
Now it's your choice.
It's your only choice.
I don't see that we have any choice.
I can hear sadness in your voice.
I didn't raise my voice.
We all have a price.
Every dream comes at a price.
It doesn't come without a price.
We need some supplies and figured you could get us a good price.
They're asking 3 million dollar and I think would be a steal at twice the price.
They got into an argument over the price.
You were wrong about the price.
I'd want to be sure that I was ready to pay the price.
Everything has its price.
It can be yours, for the right price.
Tell me your needs and I'll tell you my price.
You can ask any price.
I thought I'd get in some target practice.
Tom has been brought to justice.
I want the person who did this brought to justice.
I don't want you offering my girlfriend dating advice.
We value your advice.
Tom had the gall to ignore my advice.
My policy is, you pay full price, you get full service.
I don't need to hear it twice.
We feel Tom needs some spiritual guidance.
They'll pay a price for their arrogance.
The new manager never gave me a chance.
Without your protection, Tom won't have a chance.
You're not even giving it a chance.
Tom should've listened to you and bought that painting when he had the chance.
Tom should've asked Mary to marry him while he still had the chance.
It's worth the chance.
Tom jumped at the chance.
I won't get the chance.
There is but one chance.
Tom is taking a tremendous chance.
It's your last chance.
You were my last chance.
It's your best chance.
I had my chance.
Tom and Mary exchange an amused glance.
I never even gave her a second glance.
Tom was in a trance.
I know how to make an entrance.
I've already spent my inheritance.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
It's of no importance.
I've been admiring you from a distance.
We're pulling back to a safe distance.
I've been hearing gunfire in the distance.
We require no assistance.
This is kind of a special circumstance.
I'll give you half my allowance.
Tom will have a chance to prove his innocence.
Tom told Mary that she should get rid of the evidence.
Tom got rid of the evidence.
I've discovered new evidence.
Tom was on the fence.
Tom placed the ladder against the fence.
I can't have this on my conscience.
Tom wanted an audience.
It was a very pleasurable experience.
That hasn't been my experience.
Tom, someday I'll reward you for all your patience.
There was a dead silence.
There was dead silence.
There was an awkward silence.
A gruff voice broke the silence.
Tom broke the silence.
There was a moment of complete silence.
There was complete silence.
There was a brief silence.
There was a long silence.
Tom broke the long silence.
They ate in silence.
They went on eating in silence.
Tom motioned for silence.
Please forgive my impertinence.
I put Tom down as a reference.
I swore I'd make a difference.
That makes all the difference.
Tom never knew the difference.
There's a lot of difference.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
We can't risk them detecting our presence.
Tom isn't questioning your competence.
Tom said Mary was a bad influence.
Tom is a man of considerable influence.
I've been with Tom ever since.
Tom meant a lot to me once.
I know you two had a thing once.
Don't everyone thank me at once.
I must leave Boston at once.
Tom didn't reply at once.
I'll make myself scarce.
I hear the competition is pretty fierce.
The choice has been made.
I respect the decision you made.
The bed is unmade.
I can't continue with this charade.
Tom was held back a grade.
Tom teaches the third grade.
That would help me decide.
You have one minute to decide.
We're investigating a homicide.
I'm not going to let you commit suicide.
Tom clearly has something to hide.
I know all the places to hide.
I've got nowhere left to hide.
You better hide.
I suggest you hide.
Thanks for saving my hide.
We took a ride.
You're in for a bumpy ride.
Mary was such a lovely bride.
Tom seems to be taking things in stride.
You're on the wrong side.
We've got the truth on our side.
The law is on our side.
I'm definitely not on your side.
I'll be right by your side.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
Look on the bright side.
Hey, Tom, look on the bright side.
The law's on my side.
Tom was right by my side.
Tom is still parked outside.
Now, why don't we continue this conversation outside.
A limo has just pulled up outside.
Tom's eyes opened wide.
Tom opened his eyes wide.
You've got the wrong code.
Tom looks about ready to explode.
That's a very enlightened attitude.
You just need some coffee.
We're going to need some more coffee.
My services are free.
Tom was happy and carefree.
I heartily agree.
I'm hardly in a position to disagree.
Tom can be trusted to some degree.
I'd like to buy something in a size three.
I'll give you to the count of three.
Now you've got all three.
I climbed a tree.
Birds were chirping in the tree.
It's all going to work out, you'll see.
I can see what I need to see.
That's what I like to see.
This I have to see.
It was a sight to see.
Maybe you're seeing what you want to see.
Tom says he sees things that I can't see.
Tell me how many lights you see.
I can only see what you see.
That much I guarantee.
You don't want to do anything to void the guarantee.
We have no guarantee.
I want to get you someplace where I know you'll be safe.
They were safe.
We can't be too safe.
Tom always plays it safe.
I have a life.
I want a life.
I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life.
You're throwing away your entire life.
I've never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.
I've been preparing for this my entire life.
I don't want to pry into your private life.
Tom is in the prime of life.
I know I haven't lived the model life.
I'm trying to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life.
That'll cost you your life.
There's been an attempt on Tom's life.
Tom told me the story of his life.
Tom narrowly escapes with his life.
Tom has never missed a day's work in his life.
Tom never had a plan in his life.
Tom was scared for his life.
Tom is fighting for his life.
Tom was also passionate about life.
I want to tell you all about my new life.
You were my life.
I've had the time of my life.
You were the love of my life.
I've just wasted three years of my life.
You're part of my life.
I trust Tom with my life.
I have to go on with my life.
I've tried to get on with my life.
I'd trust you with my life.
I've never seen this woman before in my life.
I've never seen any of you before in my life.
I've never heard so much complaining in my life.
I've never wanted anything so much in my life.
I won't beg for my life.
Tom was armed with a kitchen knife.
I have an understanding wife.
I met the person who killed your wife.
I was so sorry to hear about your wife.
Tom wanted us to investigate the murder of his wife.
Tom is financially dependent on his wife.
Tom wanted to hide the money from his ex-wife.
Tom should know better at his age.
I don't believe in any of that garbage.
I felt like a bird in a cage.
I need to change that bandage.
It's a green card marriage.
I know all about marriage.
Don't worry, there's been no permanent damage.
I think we can manage.
Tom wasn't put in jail for espionage.
Tom drew a line down the middle of the page.
Tom printed out the page.
We're on the same page.
Tom turned another page.
You made the front page.
You don't even have a webpage.
I need you in the garage.
They've increased Tom's dosage.
Tom handed Mary the message.
Call when you get this message.
You've always had an advantage.
I checked the gauge.
I had no such knowledge.
Tom leaned over the bridge.
See if there's juice in the fridge.
Tom tried to open the door, but it wouldn't budge.
You eat like you're still in college.
It's OK to indulge, just don't over indulge.
You said you want to make a change.
I might be ready for a change.
I can feel the change.
Tom was bewildered by the change.
You need to make a real change.
I don't know how easy it'll be to change.
I don't know what you think is going to change.
Some things aren't going to change.
I guess some things aren't going to change.
That's about to change.
That'll never change.
Some things will never change.
It's hard to tell at this range.
Tom is really acting strange.
It feels strange.
It's all very strange.
I know we're about to face a challenge.
Tom rose to the challenge.
Tom is undaunted by the challenge.
I gladly accept your challenge.
I'll take that challenge.
It's a question of who's in charge.
The group was too large.
Tom's killer is still at large.
Tom is suffering from a headache.
Tom had a bad headache.
Save yourself the headache.
I had a severe headache.
I had a splitting headache.
Tom walks like a zombie.
When Tom died, I wanted to die.
You should be the one to die.
Tom told me they're all going to die.
Tom said I was going to die.
Tom knew he was going to die.
I couldn't leave Tom to die.
No one else needs to die.
Nobody deserves to die.
That would be a terrible way to die.
Tell anyone about this and you die.
We're not about to let you die.
Tom is a tough cookie.
Tom is one tough cookie.
You're one sharp cookie.
That would be a lie.
I can't tell a lie.
That's a stinking lie.
That's no lie.
No one's asking you to lie.
Tom is a sweetie pie.
I don't need a tie.
I don't have a favorite tie.
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing that tie.
Tom ripped off his bow tie.
Tom is nuttier than a fruitcake.
Tom is as nutty as a fruitcake.
Tom won't get a fair shake.
They're hard to make.
I wonder what I should do with all the money I'm about to make.
We'll support any decision you make.
It's a risk we're prepared to take.
It's a risk we're all prepared to take.
It's a risk I'm prepared to take.
There's too much at stake.
I don't have to tell you what's at stake.
You were a mistake.
I can see how you might've made that mistake.
It's an honest mistake.
It was an honest mistake.
That was an honest mistake.
Tell Tom to take a hike.
That's the part I like.
I can do that if you'd like.
I know exactly what it's like.
Tom just wanted to see what it was like.
Tom says he didn't know what it was like.
I don't care what Tom looks like.
That's the part I don't like.
That's what Tom does to those he doesn't like.
I can make a call if you like.
I can do that if you like.
I can look at that if you like.
Tom treats everything like a joke.
It's Tom's idea of a joke.
Tell me this is a joke.
Tom laughed at the joke.
My life is like a sick joke.
This is somebody's sick joke.
Tom had a minor stroke.
It was a fluke.
Tom looks like he's about to puke.
Tom was very pale.
I think we made a sale.
Tom's reputation is impeccable.
That is unavoidable.
I think that's understandable.
I do think this is understandable.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
I've done something unforgivable.
Tom seems approachable.
It was unthinkable.
There isn't one available.
Ask Tom to make himself available.
Have Tom join me when he's available.
I know someone who's available.
It seems perfectly reasonable.
Tom slumped against the wall, exhausted and miserable.
Tom is sitting on a park bench, looking miserable.
It's admirable.
Tom's loyalty is admirable.
They say it's incurable.
I don't need a table.
Tom placed some cups of tea on the table.
Tom is lying on the table.
Tom left the book on the table.
Tom examined the objects on the table.
Tom is sitting at his usual table.
I need your help clearing this table.
Get that off my table.
Tom tends to be unpredictable.
It might be profitable.
I was just being hospitable.
That's very hospitable.
If anything happens, I'm accountable.
I can make them more comfortable.
Tom tried to make himself comfortable.
I only wanted to make you comfortable.
It made me uncomfortable.
It was rather uncomfortable.
Tom is extremely unstable.
This story you're telling is unbelievable.
That meal was incredible.
Tom's voice was hardly audible.
You're not so horrible.
The whiskey was horrible.
I won't quit until we find out who's responsible.
Tom was responsible.
I wanted to find who was responsible.
Tom knows there's only one course of action possible.
Tell me how that's possible.
I guess theoretically it's possible.
I want to put all this behind me as soon as possible.
I want to show it to Tom as soon as possible.
I want a full evaluation as soon as possible.
I'd like to get under way as soon as possible.
A great deal more is possible.
I've done everything humanly possible.
It'd be impossible.
That'd be impossible.
Tom is always trying to do the impossible.
Tom says we're not compatible.
Tom drives some sort of little white convertible.
Tom was irresistible.
I'll make yours a double.
I thought I'd save you the trouble.
I'll save you the trouble.
Tom isn't going to give us any more trouble.
I'm in desperate trouble.
Tom didn't give me an ounce of trouble.
I can tell you've gone to a lot of trouble.
You don't want to get in trouble.
Tom, assure me there's going to be no trouble.
Tom realized he was in deep trouble.
You shouldn't go looking for trouble.
Call if there's trouble.
Don't go to all this trouble.
I always expect trouble.
In my profession, I always expect trouble.
Tom knew this meant trouble.
It's been nothing but trouble.
I hope we don't run into any trouble.
Call me if there's any trouble.
I don't think Tom will give us any trouble.
You and I both know you were the one who stole Tom's bicycle.
Tom hopped on his motorcycle.
I have to skedaddle.
Tom turned the handle.
It cost me a bundle.
Tom tossed Mary a rifle.
Tom made a grab for the rifle.
There's no sign of a struggle.
Tom's life has been a struggle.
Tom disappeared into the jungle.
Tom was an imbecile.
Let me have the file.
Tom went through the file.
We like to keep a low profile.
Tom waited a while.
That could take a while.
I know it's been a while.
Give yourself a break once in a while.
Tom continued after a while.
Tom has obviously been dead for a while.
I'm going to ask you to stay around for a while.
Tom is going to crash here for a while.
It was touch-and-go there for a while.
Tom has obviously been listening for a while.
Tom pondered the question for a while.
I thought we could hang out in Boston for a while.
I want you to get out of town for a while.
Tom has been stalking Mary for a while.
Tom has been at it a while.
It just might take Tom a little while.
I do remember you were in Boston for a short while.
Tom didn't crack a smile.
Tom tried to muster a smile.
I make you smile.
You need to shut your pie hole.
Tom peeked out the peephole.
I hope you like tuna noodle casserole.
It was quite simple.
The process is simple.
Let's make this simple.
It's never that simple.
It's all very simple.
Let's settle down, people.
You have your orders, people.
I know how to read people.
Tom has murdered three people.
We're reasonable people.
You're frightening these people.
I take care of people.
I can't sing in front of people.
What happened to Tom happens to a lot of people.
I don't like upsetting people.
I enjoy communicating with people.
I became a lawyer to help people.
Tom knows how to help people.
You have more restraint than most people.
I just never will understand you people.
Tom is surrounded by people.
These are my people.
I didn't make you a cripple.
We make quite a couple.
You guys make such a cute couple.
You guys are such a cute couple.
You two make such an attractive couple.
You guys make a very attractive couple.
I don't need a whistle.
I'm clean as a whistle.
I won't blow the whistle.
Tom turned off the boiling kettle.
We have some things to settle.
Tom stiffened a little.
Tom stammered a little.
It scares me a little.
Tom drew back a little.
I want you to pitch in a little.
I thought we could catch up a little.
We all need to lighten up a little.
Tom quickly hid the bottle.
I'll take the bottle.
You almost had me.
I've chosen you to succeed me.
I have patients who need me.
I'll be close by if you need me.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
You knew that when you married me.
You've already thanked me.
You already thanked me.
I still wouldn't know if Tom hadn't called me.
You could've fooled me.
It bothered me.
I know why you've contacted me.
I don't know how they spotted me.
Tom immediately recognized me.
We never had much in common, you and me.
This isn't about you and me.
Say you understand me.
I'm more than willing to put it behind me.
Don't say that name around me.
You don't have to tiptoe around me.
They must not have heard me.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
I'm really glad you can see me.
I don't think Tom was particularly pleased to see me.
You're the one that wanted to see me.
I just want to make you as happy as you want to make me.
You're just a thief like me.
I already know that Tom doesn't like me.
Tom is trying to provoke me.
If I don't get to Boston for the convention, my boss will fire me.
That's why you should hire me.
Tom was the manager before me.
You don't have to lecture me.
You're attempting to confuse me.
I used to dream about you coming to save me.
I need someone to believe me.
I need you to believe me.
I can only hope that in time you'll forgive me.
Don't tell me this doesn't involve me.
I just want Tom to love me.
That's why you love me.
You can owe me.
That's another one you owe me.
You don't need to patronize me.
You don't have to patronize me.
I had my whole life ahead of me.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
I guess you've heard of me.
You said you want to take care of me.
It was selfish of me.
I know what people think of me.
Just stay in front of me.
You haven't heard the last of me.
They wormed it out of me.
I want you to know I appreciate your recommending me.
Thanks for asking me.
That's what they have been telling me.
Thanks for telling me.
Thanks for not telling me.
One thing's bothering me.
Stop protecting me.
Tom made a point of visiting me.
Stop tormenting me.
They can't touch me.
Tom, don't play dumb with me.
I know you must be frustrated with me.
You don't have to pretend with me.
Your secret will die with me.
I can make any woman fall in love with me.
Maybe something's wrong with me.
That's totally cool with me.
I don't know why you have a problem with me.
You can be completely open with me.
I brought my gun with me.
Please bear with me.
You have every reason to be upset with me.
Don't toy with me.
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Tom is a fool, if you ask me.
I really wish you'd call me.
That's what people call me.
I think you may as well tell me.
That's what my doctors tell me.
You're the expert, so you tell me.
I want you to find what Tom took from me.
Nothing can be hidden from me.
Tom hid things from me.
You didn't hear that from me.
Move away from me.
You can't take that away from me.
Don't expect any mercy from me.
I had a father who believed in me.
No one believes in me.
Tom has never laid a hand on me.
It'll be on me.
Tom took a chance on me.
Don't you dare bail on me.
Tom threatened to tell on me.
Tom sometimes drops in on me.
Don't you give up on me.
The cab ride's on me.
My mind must be playing tricks on me.
Maybe my memories are playing tricks on me.
I know you're holding out on me.
You've been holding out on me.
Don't you pass out on me.
You should've come and talked to me.
That's not how it looked to me.
This isn't unlike what happened to me.
Tom turned to me.
You're so attracted to me.
Tom has been a good friend to me.
Tom was once a very good friend to me.
It wouldn't kill you to be nice to me.
One of them spoke to me.
It's good that you came to me.
You didn't have to come to me.
Apologies mean nothing to me.
That may mean nothing to you, but it means everything to me.
Tom meant everything to me.
I didn't like what Tom was doing to me.
Please come back to me.
It's all coming back to me.
You'll talk to me.
Stand up when you talk to me.
It would mean a great deal to me.
Now you listen to me.
That's of no concern to me.
Tom made himself known to me.
You seem real familiar to me.
Tom has been a good father to me.
This isn't fair to me.
They did things to me.
I'm not sure you realize how important Tom is to me.
I'm just glad it wasn't you who did this to me.
You're precious to me.
Hey, you can't say that to me.
I'm not going to let Tom get to me.
I'm not letting it get to me.
You're a valuable asset to me.
You still have to prove it to me.
That used to mean a lot to me.
Your being here means a lot to me.
That may mean nothing to you, but it means a lot to me.
That really meant a lot to me.
Tom has been a great comfort to me.
Tom made a polite bow to me.
I was hoping you had something to say to me.
I don't know what got into me.
Tom is sure to try and stop me.
You might just be able to stop me.
I would hate to have a disease named after me.
They named the library after me.
Cut up my food for me.
You know Mondays are hard for me.
Tom knew it would be too hard for me.
You might put in a word for me.
That goes double for me.
This isn't a good time for me.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
Tom was there for me.
I need you to set up a meeting for me.
I knew you'd come through for me.
You're such a role model for me.
See, that's going to be a problem for me.
Tom has got it in for me.
You asked me what you could do for me.
Tom is covering up for me.
I need you to open the door for me.
I really can't thank you enough that you're doing this for me.
I'm not telling you to do this for me.
You always made my decisions for me.
I can't believe you would do that for me.
You have no respect for me.
Don't ruin it for me.
That's what worries me.
I can't tell you how glad that makes me.
I can't tell you how sad that makes me.
I can't tell you how pleased that makes me.
I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
I can't tell you how unhappy that makes me.
I can't tell you how angry that makes me.
That's what troubles me.
His name escapes me.
Tom intrigues me.
Tom is the only one who loves me.
That's what concerns me.
That's what bothers me.
You don't have to impress me.
I think Tom suspects me.
I'll kill the first one who disobeys me.
You have to look at me.
Tom looked up at me.
Everybody yells at me.
Tom looked straight at me.
Tom looked right at me.
I know you have reason to doubt me.
When Tom was alive, he could protect me.
Tom is lying to protect me.
Tom is out to get me.
I guess you've caught me.
You knew exactly where to hit me.
You still manage to disappoint me.
Tom was going to shoot me.
I don't need you to support me.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I won't let you hurt me.
You made it personal against me.
You've lost me.
I just need you to trust me.
I had to make you trust me.
You have the wrong idea about me.
I didn't know that Tom talked about me.
I never even knew you cared about me.
I never knew you cared about me.
You said some nice things about me.
I know all of you have doubts about me.
You couldn't live without me.
Tom was going to betray me.
You're foolish to think you can defy me.
That's not why I came.
I needed you and you came.
Remember that this isn't a game.
I'm here for the card game.
You're intentionally throwing the game.
You can't watch the game.
Tom is sure that he'll win the game.
We have ourselves a whole new ball game.
I know chess isn't really your game.
I know darts isn't really your game.
Tom's definitely off his game.
I'm really tired of this game.
I think Tom would be a good name.
I'd like to be able to tell people my real name.
That's not my real name.
I really like it when you say my name.
You can't give yourself a nickname.
Tom really needs a better nickname.
We'll never be the same.
In my place, Tom would've done the same.
It doesn't look the same.
It's just not the same.
I know all about your little scheme.
They're investigating a crime.
I'm here to report a crime.
Tom was never convicted of the crime.
Tom must pay the price for his crime.
I've been charged with a serious crime.
Tom was happy for a time.
Please let me answer one question at a time.
At least somebody is having a good time.
Tom seems to have had a very hard time.
I guess I could've made the time.
We'll make the time.
Tom laughed all the time.
Love happens in the workplace all the time.
I have to watch them all the time.
I can't be watching Tom all the time.
You tell me that all the time.
If anyone wants to surrender, now's the time.
Now isn't the time.
I wasn't aware of that at the time.
You need to make time.
Tom does this every single time.
Tom has been way ahead of me the whole time.
I've wanted to tell you this for some time.
I can't afford to waste any more time.
Tom wants us to move up our departure time.
I'm afraid you've arrived in Boston at a most unfortunate time.
I don't think I have that kind of time.
I don't think we have that kind of time.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
I owe you big time.
It's quitting time.
You and I go back a long time.
I haven't heard that particular saying in a long time.
I've been after them for a long time.
I won't be back this way for a long time.
Tom has been in there an awfully long time.
Tom has been around a very long time.
Tom was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
That still doesn't give us much time.
We'll never get one here in time.
I really did love Tom at one point in time.
I'll see to it that we complete this project on time.
We should be there in no time.
I'll be checking your progress from time to time.
I'm sorry, but we're rushed for time.
Tom is still stalling for time.
Tom was playing for time.
I was just playing for time.
I'm just advising you not to waste your time.
I'll let you know when it's time.
Tom has really outdone himself this time.
We don't require assistance at this time.
You're losing precious time.
I couldn't talk on the phone at that time.
Tom might have been sleeping at that time.
I didn't know what it meant at that time.
It's the right time.
I've been lied to by Tom for the last time.
There's always a first time.
I don't think you heard me the first time.
It's not my first time.
There isn't going to be a next time.
It was before my time.
You're seriously wasting my time.
I've given a speech or two in my time.
I imagine that's what's going to happen every time.
We should talk sometime.
You need some downtime.
There's more to come.
You better come.
Tom would be happy to know you've finally come.
I came to give you a ride home.
Welcome to our humble home.
I need to come home.
I just want to get everyone home.
Find Tom and bring him home.
I can at least take Tom home.
I've got to get Tom home.
Tom told the cop he had just gotten home.
You're not even safe in your own home.
Tom hinted very strongly that he wanted to go home.
It's too close to home.
I've got a child at home.
Tom saw a light on in the house and figured someone was at home.
You can finish it at home.
Have a safe journey home.
Tom is indeed quite handsome.
There are some who would consider Tom handsome.
You're looking extraordinarily handsome.
You're getting very tiresome.
That's going to look good on my resume.
Tom was wearing a Superman costume.
Somebody sabotaged this plane.
I thought you were probably insane.
Tom was sentenced to life in a prison for the criminally insane.
Tom was pronounced dead on the scene.
Tom uncorked the champagne.
I don't know anything about cocaine.
I paid a fine.
That'd be fine.
They're going to be fine.
I think we're fine.
Hang in there, Tom, you're doing fine.
I'm sure it will all work out fine.
That's hard to imagine.
I know more than you could possibly imagine.
Tom put the documents through the shredding machine.
It's your reputation that's on the line.
I'm sorry, I know I was out of line.
That'll keep Tom in line.
We're trying to see who can come up with the best pick up line.
I'll never get used to skyrocketing prices for gasoline.
It's going to be mine.
That exact same thing happened to a good friend of mine.
That very thing happened to a good friend of mine.
Tom Jackson was a boyhood hero of mine.
The pleasure's mine.
I've got mine.
Just so we're clear, that was Tom's idea, not mine.
I'm under quarantine.
I'm sure you already know the routine.
Tom never varies his routine.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom prefers red wine to white wine.
I never really cared for white wine.
Tom took a drink from a bottle of wine.
Tom took another swig of wine.
Tom was relaxing, drinking a glass of wine.
Tom is sitting at the table, drinking wine.
I didn't even know that you had one.
You're an odd one.
I know a good divorce lawyer if you need one.
You're the married one.
Have a good one.
Tom thought Mary was the weird one.
You're the strange one.
I'm the insane one.
We're going back to square one.
It's back to square one.
I could use one.
It's a tough one.
You're the cool one.
Tom knew no one.
The odds are two to one.
You can't handle another one.
Tom's a clever one.
I need a new extension cord like this one.
Every day won't all be like this one.
I don't think there's any way out of this one.
Let's try it with this one.
Tom isn't budging on this one.
You really lucked out on this one.
Let me be your plus one.
Tom's not quite sure of that one.
We can't do anything with that one.
Tom really came through on that one.
You can sleep on that one.
I was wrong about that one.
Your path is a difficult one.
Tom's path is a difficult one.
I can only guess that you must want one.
I totally owe you one.
I'll run out and get you one.
You told me I was the only one.
I'm the crazy one.
It's almost time for planting and there's a lot left to be done.
I finally have the strength to do what must be done.
Tom is asking if we're done.
I don't think you realize what you've done.
Tom, look what you've done.
I could kill you for what you've done.
It's the best thing Tom has ever done.
The deal is done.
Tom was there for me when I really needed someone.
I think I just heard someone.
I think Tom might be seeing someone.
They were gone.
Tom looks pretty far gone.
I want to know who used to live here and where he's gone.
The magic is gone.
The truck is gone.
I just can't believe Tom is gone.
I need you gone.
Tom groggily answered the phone.
Tom is on the bed, talking on the phone.
Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
Get me Tom on the phone.
We can't get Tom on the phone.
Tom left a detailed message on Mary's cell phone.
Tom went over to the telephone.
Tom was glad to be alone.
It's better to be alone.
Tom might arrive alone.
I'm so alone.
I don't think I care for your tone.
I had a kidney stone.
Tom never killed anyone.
Tom would kill me if I told anyone.
I've never been violent toward anyone.
This will hardly convince anyone.
I always thought I could work with anyone.
Tom still hasn't made eye contact with anyone.
I'm not trying to trick anyone.
Tom didn't dare tell anyone.
Tom never raised a hand to anyone.
Tom isn't the sort to apologize to anyone.
If you can talk to Tom, you can talk to anyone.
Tom lives in seclusion and rarely sees anyone.
We're not asking that you betray anyone.
Just sit tight, everyone.
These are just routine questions we ask everyone.
I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone.
I don't want to ruin the evening for everyone.
Tom is well-liked by everyone.
Tom was walking down the street, whistling a tune.
Tom was smart enough to escape.
I know Tom isn't in very good shape.
Tom is wearing a stethoscope.
You don't look like a dope.
Someone told you I was coming, I hope.
It's our one hope.
I had one last hope.
You were our last hope.
You're our best hope.
It might be our only hope.
It may be your only hope.
I'm your only hope.
Tom cautiously opened the envelope.
You must admit this would present quite a slippery slope.
Tom is at the end of his rope.
I know the type.
We are what we are.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
You know what our instructions are.
I can sense how worried you are.
Tom isn't in the same place you are.
I'm trying to figure it out just like you are.
We're ready to go if you are.
I'm ready to go if you are.
I accept you for who you are.
I can see how upset you are.
I can sense how upset you are.
You don't know how right you are.
I can sense how angry you are.
Tell us where they are.
I wish I could tell you who they are.
I don't think they're who they say they are.
Tom's feet were bare.
You can walk for all I care.
You're going to require care.
It's safe to say they don't much care.
I believe you do care.
Tom is under a doctor's care.
Tell me why you care.
There was a bomb scare.
I'm not living on welfare.
We all have secrets we'd prefer not to share.
Tom gave Mary an icy glare.
Living with you would be a nightmare.
What happened to Tom was a nightmare.
Tom gave Mary an icy stare.
You won, fair and square.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
I'm sure Tom is quite sincere.
I have nothing to add here.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
Hey, I'm practically naked here.
Nothing like that ever happened here.
Tell Tom everything that happened here.
I want guards posted here.
We've got one rule around here.
I don't want Tom coming around here.
People are trying to eat around here.
I never thought I'd be here.
It's not safe for me to be here.
You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not really old enough to be here.
It's way too dangerous for us to be here.
You're ruining what could be the most important night of my life here.
I like the people here.
You have many different kinds of people here.
We're on a very tight schedule here.
Tom was the reason why I came here.
That's why we came here.
I don't think we're welcome here.
You're way out of line here.
Listen, Tom can't know you're here.
I like the friendly atmosphere here.
You're playing with fire.
It's important to look at the big picture here.
You're no less a victim than anyone else here.
I don't know how to behave here.
I happen to live here.
I'll let you off here.
I'm busting out of here.
Let's try and get Tom out of here.
I want Tom out of here.
I can get us out of here.
I need your help to get out of here.
I can get you out of here.
I'm getting a bad feeling here.
That's what I'm doing here.
I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
I'm perfectly comfortable waiting here.
I'm waiting here.
You're out of your depth here.
You can't be back here.
You go and get Tom and then come back here.
I'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here.
I can't hear myself think here.
Tom said you could work here.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
We're not in control here.
I suspect you know why I'm here.
I'm the victim here.
You won't believe the view from here.
People are trying to sleep in here.
I hope there's plenty of air in here.
I hope there's enough air in here.
You two get in here.
I'm very busy in here.
I'm starting to get a picture of what's going on here.
It's pretty clear what's going on here.
Something very strange is going on here.
I don't know what you think is going on here.
You can't be down here.
Maybe you should come down here.
You don't have to sleep down here.
There's nothing more Tom can do here.
There must be somebody else up here.
I'm burning up here.
I'm up here.
It's lovely up here.
Tom is the floor manager here.
You're not a prisoner here.
The door's over here.
Let's have another round of beers over here.
Tom, look who's here.
I didn't think you'd come while Tom was here.
I'm not comfortable discussing this here.
We're the victims here.
I'm trying to get you to focus here.
I came by last night, but you weren't here.
I don't know what you're getting at here.
It took you long enough to get here.
I've got proof right here.
I just happen to have a contract right here.
I get the feeling something's not right here.
You don't get to sit here.
We're in the middle of an argument here.
That's how I got here.
If you're looking for Tom, he's not here.
I'm in a bit of a tight spot here.
I think Tom slept here.
Let's be honest here.
It's not just here.
Thanks for letting us hang out here.
We can work something out here.
That's why I called you here.
I'm of no use to you here.
I think there's a place for you here.
I've got something for you here.
That's why I brought you here.
I'm dead if I stay here.
Your lives are in danger if you stay here.
We're in uncharted territory here.
I'm sensing a little hostility here.
You're not a good enough pilot to be able to land there.
Tom just stood there.
Name the time and place, and I'll be there.
Tom never bothered to tell Mary that he wasn't going to be there.
I must be there.
Tom just left me there.
Evidence will show Tom was the only one there.
Tell me you're there.
You have to get out of there.
Tom is anxious to get out of there.
Sorry, I didn't see you standing there.
There was something there.
You really had me going there.
It's just sitting there.
I know you're back there.
Tom won't even know I'm there.
I can rent a boat from there.
Thanks, Tom. I'll take it from there.
Let's see what they have and we'll take it from there.
I knew I had been there.
I don't know what came over me in there.
Don't make me come in there.
It's all in there.
I know you're still in there.
I don't like Tom in there.
I have to see who's in there.
We almost bought it in there.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
You never know who might need something up there.
I didn't make it up there.
That's why I was there.
Tom peeked into Mary's room, but she wasn't there.
I just don't see why we have to eat there.
I'll let you know when I get there.
I don't know how that got there.
We were almost there.
You were almost there.
That was a good thing that just happened out there.
You did pretty good out there.
I wanted to see if there really was someone out there.
We can't send Tom out there.
It's a scorcher out there.
There are wolves out there.
I didn't even see you there.
I can get you there.
You wouldn't last a day there.
Everyone has to be somewhere.
Everybody has to be somewhere.
I've got to be somewhere.
I've got to draw the line somewhere.
I knew you'd be lurking around here somewhere.
It's in here somewhere.
It had to come from somewhere.
I'm sure I know him from somewhere.
Tom's got it all written down somewhere.
Tom's mind was elsewhere.
Tom's mind is elsewhere.
Tom was in the middle of nowhere.
I don't seem to be going anywhere.
It's clear Tom isn't going anywhere.
Just put them anywhere.
There was no sign of Tom anywhere.
I can work from anywhere.
I'm never going to go anywhere.
I can't do it just anywhere.
They seem to be everywhere.
Tom knows the cops are everywhere.
I've been looking everywhere.
We have branches everywhere.
I was at home the night of the fire.
Tom was burned to death in the fire.
Tom tended to the fire.
Your garbage can is on fire.
Tom is a new hire.
Tom began to perspire.
We could have anything our hearts desire.
I was asked to wear a wire.
We know the score.
I've been down that road before.
Tom looks thinner than he did before.
I've never had to deal with the police before.
Tom never mentioned any of this to me before.
That wasn't here before.
I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
I've seen that look before.
Tom has heard it all before.
I've never seen Tom with a girl before.
You never told me about Tom before.
I'll work even harder than before.
After Tom wiped the table with a dirty rag, it looked dirtier than before.
I never thought along those lines before.
Tom has been in tight spots before.
You should've thought of that before.
I'm trying to figure out where we met before.
It's not like I haven't heard it before.
I don't know why I didn't see it before.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
I've never had a beer in the middle of the day before.
I've never been on a jury before.
I guess I was expecting a little more.
There's nothing that would please me more.
I needed something more.
Tom and Mary were friends, nothing more.
Tom could say nothing more.
Tom could do no more.
Tom could say no more.
I have a lot more.
I had to know more.
I've been here thirteen days, possibly more.
They don't want to lose any more.
It's not safe for Tom to be around me anymore.
I don't practice medicine anymore.
I don't think we're welcome around here anymore.
I can't help myself anymore.
I just don't find Tom that exciting anymore.
I can't stand lying anymore.
Tom isn't holding anything back anymore.
I can barely sleep at all anymore.
You have nothing to fear anymore.
I don't think we can see each other anymore.
I don't think we're right for each other anymore.
Tom won't lie for you anymore.
I don't know how to be happy anymore.
Tom was impossible to ignore.
Tom swore.
Tom was insecure.
A tonsillectomy is a very simple procedure.
I don't need the brochure.
Tom told me the project had been a failure.
I needed to be sure.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
Tom has a forgiving nature.
It doesn't exist in nature.
Tom isn't a suspicious person by nature.
The contract doesn't yet have their signature.
Tom just asked me to take your temperature.
Let's not paint too pretty a picture.
I think you're missing the big picture.
Tom has an enormous appetite for adventure.
Tom says he can see into the future.
I think they want to destroy the base.
The opposite is the case.
Tom is obviously a mental case.
I'll make an exception in your case.
Tom is carrying a briefcase.
Don't leave me again, please.
Tom aims to please.
Tom examined the new purchase.
Tom is just going through a phase.
I always like wine and cheese.
I wanted to bring you these.
We're not at war with the Japanese.
Let's go for Chinese.
I needed the exercise.
Tom never failed to keep his promise.
It's a reasonable compromise.
Tom made a noise.
I don't know how you can put up with all this noise.
Tom feigned surprise.
Receiving a gift from you was an unexpected surprise.
That was a fun surprise.
Tom showed no surprise.
Tom's face showed his surprise.
I suppose I'll just have to improvise.
Tom couldn't get a word in edgewise.
You shouldn't feel compelled to do otherwise.
The charges were false.
Tom was killed someplace else.
I thought you'd found someone else.
I thought you had found someone else.
Tom realized that Mary must be seeing someone else.
I thought you were seeing someone else.
I think you've confused me with someone else.
I wouldn't tell that to anyone else.
I won't discuss this with you or anyone else.
You have the same chance as everyone else.
Tom couldn't go anywhere else.
You're destined for something else.
Maybe they came for something else.
Let me tell you something else.
I'll tell you something else.
You can come, but don't tell anybody else.
I hated Tom more than anybody else.
It'd make sense.
I like things to make sense.
That makes a good deal of sense.
It made a lot of sense.
That makes a lot of sense.
Tom is devoid of common sense.
It's just common sense.
That's just common sense.
That'd make sense.
Tom just wasn't making any sense.
Nothing that's happened here makes any sense.
Tom was talking nonsense.
I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.
The mood is tense.
The crew is tense.
Tom made no response.
I've got many of those.
Tom was paid to lose.
There's not a moment to lose.
That was too close.
Boy that was close.
Tom held Mary close.
That's not very close.
It's too risky to fight them at a place they choose.
It's coming loose.
Tom is about the same age as you, I suppose.
Tom thinks you're doing it on purpose.
You're as pale as a corpse.
Tom started the car and put it in reverse.
You're backing the wrong horse.
You're timing couldn't have been worse.
It just gets worse.
I've made it worse.
It only got worse.
Hey, I could do a lot worse.
I suppose I could do a lot worse.
It can't possibly get any worse.
There's no third course.
You're free to go, of course.
We're here tonight for a good cause.
Give yourselves a round of applause.
I really can't refuse.
Tom heard sounds in the house.
We're giving you the house.
We have a warrant to search your house.
I eventually located Tom's house.
Tom parked the truck in front of Mary's house.
Tom won't allow dogs in his house.
Don't just show up at my house.
Tom knows his way around the courthouse.
That's open to debate.
I'm playing the devil's advocate.
I don't need a date.
I had no idea you were on a date.
Tom set me up on a date.
I didn't ask you on a date.
Tom is dressed for a date.
Tom told me you had a blind date.
I just want to have a normal date.
You'd better bring Tom up to date.
Tom considers himself a worthy candidate.
Tom is resigned to his fate.
I will accept my fate.
Tom exited through the gate.
I just don't feel it's appropriate.
I don't think any of this is appropriate.
It's just not appropriate.
It was totally inappropriate.
They stayed late.
I guess Tom is running late.
That could be too late.
Tom was too late.
That was why I was late.
Tom didn't mention the reason he was late.
Tom was hours late.
I'm still running a little bit late.
Tell Tom I'm sorry I made you late.
Wow, it's really late.
I don't need a plate.
You've got a lot on your plate.
Tom has got other things on his plate.
Tom might not have been so fortunate.
We have a lot to celebrate.
Tom was so considerate.
I know how you operate.
Tom is clearly frustrated and desperate.
It's hard to tell who's more desperate.
I grew desperate.
Tom isn't illiterate.
I have a friend in real estate.
Tom lives on his country estate.
You have the body of an athlete.
My happiness is complete.
Tom is all bark and no bite.
It's never black and white.
It's not always black and white.
It's not black and white.
Half the suspects were white.
I'm sick of white.
I feel like a hypocrite.
Tom glanced at the note.
I came because of something you wrote.
I call for a vote.
I'd like to remind everyone to vote.
I'm not changing my vote.
Tom has excellent taste.
Tom paused to have a cigarette.
Tom lit another cigarette.
You're incredibly cute.
That was very cute.
They should be out in a minute.
Now you just hold on for a minute.
Tom collects his thoughts for a minute.
I don't believe that for a minute.
Tom is growing more concerned by the minute.
Tom is getting more scared by the minute.
Come downstairs right this minute.
Someone could walk in here any minute.
There's one born every minute.
There's no substitute.
I don't think Tom is coming to our rescue.
You're way out of my league.
That's a little vague.
Tom knows he's in no position to argue.
Tom is in no position to argue.
Tom is in the morgue.
That was the first clue.
It just can't be true.
The rumors are true.
I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true.
But that isn't true.
That simply isn't true.
That's not totally true.
That wasn't exactly true.
You're ducking the issue.
Tom knows this is a sensitive issue.
It's not just a safety issue.
I don't need a tissue.
Tom appeared from the cave.
Tom led the way into the cave.
I hope you're not asking me to leave.
Tom made no move to leave.
I'm going to ask you both to leave.
I see no reason for us to leave.
I must ask you to leave.
I don't know what I have.
Let's be content with what we have.
I'll be happy to discuss any problem you might have.
That's not a choice you have.
I can predict how Tom will behave.
I'm not Tom's slave.
Tom placed the flowers on Mary's grave.
Let's save the ones we can save.
I don't know what I believe.
You're really good at make believe.
I know it must be hard to believe.
I don't know why that's hard to believe.
I know what I'd like to believe.
Please tell me you're not that naive.
Something has to give.
Tom doesn't have a lot to give.
I'll remember you as long as I live.
Studies have shown that the less people eat, the longer they live.
You shouldn't still be alive.
I'll bet we're the luckiest people alive.
That's why I'm still alive.
I need Tom alive.
I've never felt so alive.
At least we know Tom is alive.
Tom will eat you alive.
It's a bad time to be impulsive.
I've never done anything impulsive.
Tom is naturally a little defensive.
We must take the offensive.
Go on the offensive.
I think you might be too aggressive.
Tom's resume's impressive.
Tom is obedient, almost submissive.
Tom's very effusive.
I have a lot of initiative.
I just don't find you that attractive.
It gives you a unique perspective.
I think you've lost your perspective.
Tom was always secretive.
Tom is being held captive.
I've always fought to survive.
I think we need to replace the valve.
We've only got one problem yet to solve.
It's good to be in love.
I'm definitely falling in love.
It's the price we pay for love.
I just want to feel your love.
Tom is wearing a baseball glove.
It's a good move.
That's a good move.
Tom is on the move.
This is the right move.
I can barely move.
Tom is making soup on the stove.
You've got a lot of nerve.
I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.
The time has come to say goodbye.
Tom can only see out of one eye.
It doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye.
Tom didn't even bat an eye.
Tom glanced at Mary out of the corner of his eye.
Tom has a patch over his left eye.
I told you the interview would be a breeze.
I want you to meet my new squeeze.
You've got to apologize.
Tom made no effort to apologize.
I came by to apologize.
Tom might at least apologize.
You know me better than you realize.
I need you more than you can possibly realize.
You're the one who's tone deaf.
Tom was gagged with a handkerchief.
Tom blew his nose in a handkerchief.
Tom coughed into his handkerchief.
Tom seemed to be up to some mischief.
Tom shook his head in disbelief.
Everyone stared at Tom in disbelief.
Tom narrowed his eyes in disbelief.
This is such a relief.
Tom sighed with relief.
Tom's face showed his relief.
I'll make this brief.
I'll make this very brief.
It would be dangerous to go too near the edge of the cliff.
Tom began to sniff.
I hear the competition is pretty stiff.
Tom is pretty bad off.
Tom stormed off.
They shoved off.
I think we'd better be off.
Call your people off.
Tom's classmates are goofing off.
Tom couldn't help showing off.
You ticked them off.
Tom was definitely bought off.
Tom is still reluctant to call it off.
Tom might be able to pull it off.
Tom will be all right once he sleeps it off.
I didn't rip you off.
They blew you off.
You were told to lay off.
I like to sleep in the buff.
I'm not really into that kind of stuff.
Tom's desk is covered with stuff.
This is emotional stuff.
I see you haven't forgotten your stuff.
You know your stuff.
I need help with this stuff.
That's your half.
Tom braced himself.
Tom could've kicked himself.
Tom helped himself.
Tom cursed himself.
Tom hated himself.
Tom tried to prepare himself.
Tom took a breath and tried to compose himself.
Tom took a moment to compose himself.
Tom was ashamed of himself.
Tom was sure of himself.
Tom seems very full of himself.
Tom was defending himself.
Tom looks pleased with himself.
Tom is looking very pleased with himself.
Tom's very pleased with himself.
Tom seems very pleased with himself.
Tom is going to kill himself.
Tom lost confidence in himself.
Tom couldn't contain himself.
Tom snickered to himself.
Tom has this large room to himself.
Tom can't seem to help himself.
Tom knew he was crossing the line, but he couldn't help himself.
Tom is too weak to look after himself.
Tom said he wished to speak to you himself.
I couldn't just leave Tom there by himself.
You're not so bad yourself.
I liked the way you handled yourself.
You're no prize yourself.
I hope you're proud of yourself.
You must be kicking yourself.
Don't make this harder on yourself.
You can have this room all to yourself.
Just keep to yourself.
You can't help yourself.
Please cover yourself.
Just see for yourself.
You can make it easier for yourself.
You may have to do this yourself.
Just look at yourself.
You even said that yourself.
I'm glad you figured that out yourself.
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
The cycle is repeating itself.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
Frankly, I'm not sure it really happened myself.
Tom, this is between your father and myself.
I can drive myself.
I have to think of myself.
I was defending myself.
I've only been fooling myself.
I can live with myself.
I haven't been honest with myself.
I don't have to explain myself.
I'm quite capable of explaining the situation myself.
I smiled to myself.
I figured that much out for myself.
I'm going to have to try and handle this myself.
I'm going to handle this myself.
I'm only beginning to understand it myself.
I never really understood it myself.
I can figure it out myself.
I could kill you myself.
I don't know what they're capable of.
Tom doesn't have any enemies I can't think of.
I had a last-minute meeting I couldn't get out of.
Tom was aloof.
I need solid proof.
The cat's already out of the bag.
Mary rummaged through her bag.
Tom is a scumbag.
It's a great gag.
Tom was waving a flag.
Shake a leg.
Tom lost a leg.
Last one in is a rotten egg.
Last one out is a rotten egg.
I knew it was pretty big.
You're a disgusting pig.
You're a lying pig.
They think we're a gang.
Tom needed help with the plumbing.
This is very disturbing.
Tom resumed his pacing.
You'll wear yourself out with all that pacing.
It doesn't look too convincing.
Tom knows where this is heading.
I know where this is leading.
I'm usually better at reading.
I might need some persuading.
I don't know if there's going to be a wedding.
That's quite a secret you've been hiding.
Somebody tried to blow up our office building.
I can't believe you live in that building.
I'm glad we were able to come to an understanding.
I don't require your understanding.
Tom isn't good at pretending.
I've done some bartending.
My ears were pounding.
The alarm started ringing.
Tom makes his living by singing.
Tom could hear steps approaching.
I've done some soul-searching.
Tom's left eye started twitching.
Tom began laughing.
Tom looked so funny that I couldn't help laughing.
You look positively ravishing.
I don't see any reason for rushing.
Tom is capable of doing such a thing.
Tom knew better than to say such a thing.
We'll not tell you a thing.
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
That's probably a good thing.
Tom felt very uncomfortable about the whole thing.
Tom orchestrated this whole thing.
Anybody else would have done the same thing.
That isn't the same thing.
I could ask you the same thing.
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same thing.
I could say the same thing.
Promise me one thing.
This all adds up to one thing.
We want one thing.
Tom was correct about one thing.
You're right about one thing.
Tom was right about one thing.
I think some people do that kind of thing.
You just said the wrong thing.
There's no such thing.
I didn't do any such thing.
Simulations can't always prepare you for the real thing.
I don't want you to do another thing.
We're just waiting for Tom to do his thing.
You've done a marvelous thing.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
I know it's the right thing.
I think Tom has stopped breathing.
I thought you jury-rigged something.
Tom has indeed found something.
I think we found something.
You said Tom asked you to ask me something.
Tom was trying to tell me something.
You were about to tell me something.
I need you to tell me something.
You are something.
Tom could sense something.
Tom asked if I felt like cooking something.
Don't tell me you weren't doing something.
I feel like I'm forgetting something.
I just want to feel something.
It's got to mean something.
At least we all agree on something.
Tom was munching on something.
I'm on to something.
Tom is obviously distressed over something.
Tom was looking under the couch cushions for something.
I need to confess something.
Maybe that'll tell us something.
Maybe somebody's trying to tell us something.
I'm pretty sure Tom was trying to tell us something.
It might tell us something.
I still think I can get something.
I knew I felt something.
Tell me you've got something.
Tom seems very uncomfortable about something.
I needed to speak to you about something.
I need to speak to you about something.
That should tell you something.
You and I both know you saw something.
Call me when you know something.
I had to say something.
You were about to say something.
Tom is clearly troubled by something.
Tom seems to be puzzled by something.
Tom is perplexed by something.
Tom was dressed in casual clothing.
Tom denied nothing.
The fight had settled nothing.
Tom heard nothing.
Without me, you would be nothing.
We could see nothing.
Tom could see nothing.
They could see nothing.
Tom ate nothing.
We could end up with nothing.
Beyond that, I told Tom nothing.
Tom could do nothing.
I just think you're getting worked up over nothing.
Tom is good for nothing.
I thought you said it was nothing.
I'm sure it was nothing.
Tom has got nothing.
Give a yell if you need anything.
I can call my girlfriend anything.
Give a shout if you see anything.
We're not even sure Tom is guilty of anything.
It's not like we're doing anything.
I'm afraid to touch anything.
Tom hasn't being charged with anything.
Try not to steal anything.
It's too early to tell anything.
Nobody could tell Tom anything.
It could mean anything.
I realized I still hadn't eaten anything.
I never had to order Tom to do anything.
Tom wasn't really trying to convince Mary to do anything.
I'm never going to amount to anything.
Tom hasn't picked up anything.
Tom may not have to give up anything.
I'm not charging anybody for anything.
Tom is capable of almost anything.
Nobody's trying to tell you anything.
That's why I never tell you anything.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
This isn't going to fix anything.
You can't say anything.
Nobody's going to try anything.
Tom noticed everything.
That has changed everything.
It's a pity you destroyed everything.
Some people have to be told everything.
You can't see everything.
I'm going to make everything.
That should solve everything.
I've been trying everything.
Tom has a plan for everything.
That's Tom's answer for everything.
Tom uses sports metaphors for everything.
People tell doctors everything.
You're going to tell us everything.
I'm not saying that you have to tell me about everything.
I'm telling you everything.
You're my everything.
Your hand is shaking.
Tom is doing a little matchmaking.
You and I shouldn't be talking.
That's your pride talking.
Hey, now we're talking.
There's been enough talking.
You've got to get Tom talking.
Please refrain from talking.
Listen to who's talking.
The other kids aren't talking.
People will start talking.
I've been doing some thinking.
I know you know what I'm thinking.
Listen, I've been thinking.
I can't imagine what Tom was thinking.
Tom suddenly realized what Mary was thinking.
Tom spoke without thinking.
The light was blinking.
They were out late drinking.
Tom says he's gotten complaints about you drinking.
Tom has made up his mind to quit smoking.
Tom is an expert when it comes to cooking.
You're really tall and good-looking.
I assume that your phone is still not working.
I don't think you know what you're asking.
That's all I'm asking.
You know what I'm asking.
Pardon me for asking.
Tom cut the cards and started dealing.
It does sound appealing.
I just had a weird feeling.
It gave me a nice feeling.
I don't need any counseling.
I think you've finally found your calling.
It looks like you finally found your calling.
I can smell what you're smelling.
Tom's left arm is in a sling.
Keep hustling.
This is quite puzzling.
Tom woke from his nightmare, screaming.
The crowd was screaming.
You should've seen that one coming.
Someone knew we were coming.
I told Tom we should've contacted you before coming.
I tried to tell Tom we should've contacted you before coming.
I know it's coming.
You all had this coming.
It's not like you didn't see this coming.
I guess I should've seen this coming.
You should've seen this coming.
I never saw that coming.
Tom had it coming.
I really didn't see it coming.
You should've seen it coming.
Tom thought he was really charming.
That's what I find alarming.
The noise is deafening.
This is where it's all happening.
We understand what's happening.
Tom couldn't quite believe what was happening.
I should've anticipated this happening.
I don't really see that happening.
I don't think there's much chance of that happening.
It sounds downright frightening.
I don't see any customers complaining.
I should've told you the truth about me from the beginning.
I've been warning them from the beginning.
It's still functioning.
I spend time with Tom because he's interested in learning.
I'll have Tom at your office first thing in the morning.
The documents will be on your desk in the morning.
My car will pick you up in the morning.
Tom may be dead before morning.
I've been humming that tune to myself all morning.
Tom puttered around in the garden all morning.
I knew I shouldn't have answered the phone this morning.
Tom drinks, but he's not drunk this morning.
I received a coded message from Tom this morning.
It was in the paper this morning.
We had some words this morning.
Tom sent me roses this morning.
Tom evidently was here early this morning.
Have Tom report here tomorrow morning.
I'll ask Tom to make some time for you tomorrow morning.
I'll have the results by tomorrow morning.
I want you out of our apartment by morning.
I don't want you eating donuts every morning.
I'm glad to see your sense of humor returning.
We must know exactly what we're doing.
Please think about what you're doing.
I don't know what they think they're doing.
I came by to see how you were doing.
That's just what I'm doing.
This is your own doing.
I think I'll pop in on Tom and see how he's doing.
That's what I was doing.
I can tell you what I'm not doing.
I can't see where we're going.
It's as far as we're going.
That's where I'm going.
That's why I'm going.
Tom knew right where he was going.
I know where this is going.
This isn't exactly helping.
I'm always in the mood for shopping.
You have very acute hearing.
I know what you're offering.
I can end your suffering.
Tom's confidence is wavering.
I didn't know you were hiring.
I already know they're not hiring.
It just sounds boring.
Dinner was incredibly boring.
It's not easy to think with Tom snoring.
Tom may need some doctoring.
Tom is quite enterprising.
Tom is incapable of losing.
It's a little embarrassing.
Now, that's just embarrassing.
You need to stop obsessing.
We ended up kissing.
No one named Tom Jackson has been reported missing.
One of them is still missing.
There's a girl missing.
It was very confusing.
That was really quite amusing.
It's amusing.
Tom is a person of interest in a case we're investigating.
That's certainly worth investigating.
That's what I'm investigating.
This is really humiliating.
Today has been exhilarating.
I can't believe you're graduating.
I know it seems like I'm overreacting.
Well, Tom, you aren't what I was expecting.
I know who you're protecting.
I knew you didn't have a meeting.
Tom was asked not to speak at the meeting.
Tom and I have a dinner meeting.
I had no way of knowing who Tom was meeting.
Dinner will be waiting.
Tom was waiting.
Tom sat waiting.
I'm definitely not waiting.
Tom has a talent for writing.
It's a small price to pay for such a nice painting.
You were wrong about the painting.
Tom really likes your painting.
Tom has agreed to pay a rather steep price for that painting.
I don't think you realize what you're suggesting.
I just realized something interesting.
Tom has indeed found something interesting.
I don't find it that interesting.
You're evil and disgusting.
Your problem is that you've always been too trusting.
That's what I'm betting.
Well, that's upsetting.
Don't tell me you're quitting.
You'll get nowhere by shouting.
They were arguing.
Every life is worth saving.
I'm not worth saving.
Tom works for a living.
That's how Tom makes his living.
I'm not the one doing the driving.
Tom is in the process of moving.
That's really a good carving.
Tom sort of took me under his wing.
I can see which way the wind's blowing.
There was soft music playing.
My friend here will be paying.
Maybe it's a price worth paying.
Tom began praying.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
I don't think you realize what you're saying.
That's all I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying.
I haven't heard that particular saying.
Tom means exactly the opposite of what he's saying.
They're all either dead or dying.
It's very gratifying.
You know I don't like lying.
I'm not saying Tom is lying.
You'll be interested to hear that Tom thinks I'm hardly ever annoying.
The girls were crying.
Tom just can't stop crying.
Tom tried to comfort Mary, but she kept crying.
Now isn't the time to start worrying.
I don't see any reason for hurrying.
What's important is that you're trying.
Hey, I'm still trying.
You can't blame a girl for trying.
That'd be amazing.
I'm going to show you something amazing.
It was absolutely amazing.
I've been hearing that for a long time.
That would take too long.
It'll take too long.
Tom has been sitting behind that desk too long.
I think you've been in this town too long.
I told you Tom had been on duty too long.
You've been gone for so long.
I wondered what was taking you so long.
OK, people, move along.
I think we'll tag along.
Hey, that's what I've been saying all along.
Tom has been lying all along.
I've been with Tom all along.
Tom is making it up as he goes along.
You two would get along.
I wouldn't play along.
That's where you belong.
I know Tom comes on a little strong.
It made me strong.
You don't have to be so strong.
Tom is short, but he's strong.
It's dead wrong.
Don't be embarrassed to be wrong.
Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
I've found nothing wrong.
You've got me all wrong.
That's just plain wrong.
It just seems so wrong.
Tom has never been one to admit that he's wrong.
Tom was almost hoping he was wrong.
Tom isn't about to admit he was wrong.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
It feels wrong.
Of course, you weren't wrong.
Tom was invariably wrong.
That was a really pretty song.
Tom and Mary were young.
The day's still young.
It's a shame this had to happen to you so young.
The crowd is young.
I'm pulling the plug.
Tom is lying face down on a rug.
When I was in prison, I dreamed of the beach.
The last place anyone saw Tom was at the beach.
I already have butterflies in my stomach.
Tom says he can't work on an empty stomach.
I chose the wrong approach.
I've often wondered what it must be like to be rich.
There's more to life than just getting rich.
Tom let out a belch.
Tom and Mary sat together on the bench.
Tom seems intent on mastering French.
Tom is progressing in French.
Tom and Mary were speaking softly in French.
I highly doubt Tom knows any French.
Tom complained of the stench.
That'll do in a pinch.
I had a drink with lunch.
This will hold me until lunch.
I'm still free for lunch.
You're on your own for lunch.
We can work on it at lunch.
Tom beat us to the punch.
There's always a catch.
Tom is quite the catch.
Tom says he doesn't want to get into a shouting match.
You've met your match.
I'll take the first watch.
I'll take first watch.
I don't see why we can't just watch.
There's another hitch.
Let's take it down a notch.
I know I haven't been around much.
It doesn't look like much.
It doesn't bother me much.
I don't think that would bother Tom too much.
I don't like to plan too much.
Tom is a nice guy, except that he talks too much.
This is just too much.
I can only take so much.
You give me so much.
You've done so much.
I never knew I needed you so much.
Tom loves you so much.
I suspected as much.
I had suspected as much.
I don't think the world has changed that much.
I never minded all that much.
I didn't learn very much.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom slumped on the couch.
The cotton is high.
Tom gave a sigh.
Tom said that for the laugh.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
It's important to laugh.
I think you've helped enough.
I've suffered enough.
That better be good enough.
I'm just not good enough.
Frankly, Tom didn't try hard enough.
That seems simple enough.
That's long enough.
I'm well enough.
I think we know each other well enough.
I don't hear that often enough.
That's not soon enough.
I guess I'll find out soon enough.
It looks harmless enough.
Sometimes that just isn't enough.
That's a little rough.
Tom's promotion came through.
I want you to tell me what you're going through.
I'm not unsympathetic about what you're going through.
I think you'll pull through.
I can appreciate what you've been through.
I know exactly what you went through.
You wanted to get your mom back for everything she put you through.
We're only half way through.
I hear the competition is tough.
Tom was staring at a photograph.
Tom has got Mary on a tight leash.
I came by to feed Tom's fish.
I know I'm being selfish.
Now isn't the time to get squeamish.
Use whatever you wish.
Believe whatever you wish.
That was very harsh.
It was an ambush.
Come on, Tom, you're making me blush.
You're going to need a push.
I already gave the children their bath.
The punishment for Tom shall be death.
I've seen my share of death.
It scares me to death.
They tortured my father to death.
It looks like Tom was shot to death.
I didn't have anything to do with Tom's death.
I assume you heard about Tom's death.
I thought you might be out of breath.
They're out of breath.
Tom drew a long breath.
Tom drew a deep breath.
Tom drew a sharp breath.
Tom drew in his breath.
I won't hold my breath.
Let's do the math.
Let Tom find his own path.
I had to find my own path.
I chose another path.
I'll take this path.
Tom was lying through his teeth.
Tom is lying through his teeth.
Tom began to brush his teeth.
I guess we're not on the same wavelength.
I need someone who I can feel safe with.
I just want it over and done with.
It's nothing that I can't cope with.
It's just something I have to live with.
I forgot who I was dealing with.
I don't date women I work with.
You live next to somebody I work with.
I didn't have much to work with.
I don't have much to work with.
Tom is the one I deal with.
We've got an issue to deal with.
Listen, we have a bigger problem to deal with.
The social problems facing them seem too enormous to deal with.
I have an experiment I need help with.
I'll see what I can come up with.
I just want to get this over with.
You're grounded for a month.
I've rented a room in Boston for a month.
Tom is going away for a month.
I'll be moving out at the end of the month.
I've been burgled three times this month.
I know this is an upsetting time for you both.
Tom has got quite a mouth.
Something's coming out of your mouth.
You're obliged to tell me the truth.
Go with the truth.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I just tell the truth.
Tom didn't exactly tell the truth.
The time has come to tell Tom the truth.
I'm just trying to uncover the truth.
They wouldn't allow me to tell you the truth.
I couldn't tell you the truth.
I couldn't let Tom know the truth.
We already know the truth.
You already know the truth.
I came by to say hi.
Tom makes an excellent martini.
Tom hailed a cruising taxi.
That'll stop the leak.
You're no longer allowed to speak.
Speak when you're told to speak.
Tom forced himself to speak.
Tom is still too out of breath to speak.
Tom opened his mouth to speak.
Tom wanted Mary to speak.
Tom still didn't speak.
Tom is so stunned he can hardly speak.
I just can't catch a break.
We got a break.
You're entitled to a lunch break.
Never give a sucker an even break.
I could really go for a steak.
You've always been weak.
Tom was too weak.
Tom has lost a lot of blood and he's weak.
I just want my job back.
Tom smiled back.
Tom stepped back.
I can be laid back.
Lift with the legs, not with the back.
Tom patted me on the back.
That's why I came back.
It's all coming back.
You'll get them back.
I just want my career back.
I'm not doing anything behind your back.
Please place your hands behind your back.
Tom needs to know we've got his back.
I just thought that you might want to have this back.
I want you out of the office by the time I get back.
We'll settle this when I get back.
I promise I'll give it back.
Tom took a pistol out of his shoulder holster, checked it and put it back.
It's great having you back.
I'll do whatever it takes to get you back.
Tom and I go a long way back.
We go way back.
I think Tom should ask for his money back.
I just want my family back.
I think I just hurt my back.
We've suffered a minor setback.
I think you should cut Tom some slack.
I'm going to build you a spice rack.
The door opened a crack.
Tom packed some essentials into his knapsack.
We'd never survive another attack.
We must continue our attack.
Tom would probably have a heart attack.
You'll have to pick up the check.
I'll double check.
I'd like to do a feasibility check.
I ought to break your neck.
Tom is a total wreck.
It's a gimmick.
It could've been a trick.
That was a dirty trick.
Tom will be worried sick.
You've had me worried sick.
If I eat any more, I'll be sick.
This stuff makes me sick.
You're making us all sick.
Tom said that the mere sight of Mary made him sick.
I want to prove to you that I'm not sick.
I feel like Tom got the short end of the stick.
Get in here quick.
You catch on quick.
I'll make this quick.
I can make this quick.
Tom is almost in shock.
Circle the block.
I'm off the clock.
You missed your ten o'clock.
I suggest you duck.
I just wanted to stop by and wish you good luck.
Tom has had an incredible run of luck.
I think we're in luck.
I make my own luck.
You're pushing your luck.
I thought I'd stop by and wish you luck.
I couldn't believe my luck.
I admire your pluck.
Tom climbs into the driver's seat of the truck.
I've eaten enough for a week.
Tom and May agreed to trade places for a week.
Tom will be gone by the end of the week.
We need you to tell us why you were absent all last week.
That was last week.
I knew people would talk.
We ended up having a really good talk.
We'll have a nice long talk.
Tom must be made to talk.
This is a bad time for me to talk.
Tom is here to talk.
People are going to talk.
People are starting to talk.
Tom smiled at me and we began to talk.
It's your fault I can't talk.
I don't see why we can't talk.
They couldn't talk.
You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk.
I just thought I'd take a walk.
Tom settled his account with the bank.
You can take that to the bank.
I didn't rob any bank.
Tom's face suddenly went blank.
Tom ate and drank.
That was pretty cool, I think.
I don't know what I think.
Tom wasn't sure what to think.
That's what Tom wanted you to think.
I don't pay you to think.
You're better than you think.
I'm back in the pink.
Right now, I want you to buy me a drink.
No one's buying anyone a drink.
You look like someone who could use a drink.
Tom is at the bar nursing a drink.
At least let me buy you and your friends a drink.
I know a place where we can get a drink.
I should buy you a drink.
I was hoping you'd let me buy you a drink.
I should certainly buy you a drink.
Tom slipped something in Mary's drink.
Tom refreshed his drink.
The bartender handed Tom his drink.
I just want a quiet drink.
It looks like a slam dunk.
It's a piece of junk.
You smell like a drunk.
These things happen when you're drunk.
They were drunk.
I'm so drunk.
Tom parked his car and opened the trunk.
Please pop the trunk.
I can't believe you actually read the book.
Tom started flipping through the book.
I'm afraid that violates every rule in the book.
Tom glanced at the book.
I played it by the book.
Tom is an open book.
Tom is a pretty amazing cook.
You're off the hook.
I think your phone's off the hook.
They exchanged a look.
I think we should take a look.
Tom gave Mary a stern look.
You just had to know where to look.
Let's take another look.
Tom couldn't help but look.
Ha, I made you look.
Tom gave Mary an icy look.
That guy happens to be a crook.
Tom would do whatever it took.
It isn't fair to keep Tom in the dark.
Tom speared the shark.
Tom laughed at the remark.
I drove around the corner to park.
Tom is obviously a jerk.
The crowd went berserk.
I don't want to look like a dork.
Stop being such a dork.
I've never seen such good work.
It'll be hard work.
Being a teacher is hard work.
Being a reporter is hard work.
You just ruined three years of undercover police work.
This is how we work.
That's a dangerous line of work.
You need to find a new line of work.
I'll see you as soon as I finish work.
Twenty to one it'll work.
I know how hard you all work.
Tom doesn't think our approach will work.
I know Tom from work.
I need to focus on work.
I'll need someplace to work.
I refuse to work.
Let's talk about how this is going to work.
Tom left the office immediately after work.
It'd better work.
Tom told me he was doing some undercover work.
Tom is dressed for work.
I'm here looking for work.
I'm a fan of your work.
I'm a great admirer of your work.
I've been following your work.
Now get on with your work.
You know how these things work.
Tom seems to have finished his work.
Tom settled down to his work.
You need to make this work.
I know how you guys work.
It can't work.
I just bought this yesterday and it doesn't work.
Tom has been helping out on weekdays while I'm at work.
I'm sorry to bother you about this at work.
Tom has had an accident at work.
I made it work.
I need to make it work.
It's a wonderful idea, but it'll take a lot work.
We barely talked about work.
I know how hard you work.
I'll start the paperwork.
We've received all the proper paperwork.
For once in your life, do what I ask.
I don't have anyone else I can ask.
I'm afraid to even ask.
I know it's a lot to ask.
It's kind of you to ask.
It was nice of you to ask.
I don't know whether you can help, but I had to at least ask.
That's no easy task.
Put the gun down and move away from the desk.
Tom drummed on the desk.
Tom tossed the documents on Mary's desk.
Tom rose slowly from behind his desk.
Tom ducked down behind his desk.
Tom said it was on his desk.
Tom tapped his fingers on his desk.
Tom is already at his desk.
I agree we're taking a risk.
Tom could be a flight risk.
Tom isn't a flight risk.
Tom is certainly not a flight risk.
Tom is an obvious flight risk.
I find your arguments illogical.
It's completely illogical.
The asking price is astronomical.
I thought Tom was on sabbatical.
Timing would be critical.
Tom's condition is very critical.
I didn't want to appear hypocritical.
Tom won the sharpshooter medal.
It sounds like we've got a deal.
Tom is trying to cut a deal.
Tom really got a bad deal.
Maybe Tom made a good deal.
Let's do the deal.
This one's the real deal.
This is the real deal.
Tom really got a raw deal.
You need a good home-cooked meal.
I had a decent meal.
I came to fix you a decent meal.
We want it to look real.
The pain was real.
I couldn't tell what was real.
I didn't even know that was legal.
I didn't know that was legal.
It'd be illegal.
You didn't tell me it was illegal.
Everything Tom does is illegal.
I just want it to be special.
You must be very special.
It could be beneficial.
Tom's injuries are superficial.
I want those responsible for the massacre brought to trial.
You were an animal.
I guess everything's back to normal.
I've always had an interest in the paranormal.
Tom is completely delusional.
Tom just told me something personal.
I didn't mean to get too personal.
You're making this personal.
You don't have to get personal.
Tom's not exactly a liberal.
Tom is a decorated general.
I've decided to accept your proposal.
I had to consider Tom's proposal.
You need a lot more capital.
I wound up in the hospital.
Most of Tom's friends know that he's in the hospital.
Tom got out of the car and ran into the hospital.
Tom was sent to a mental hospital.
None of us are immortal.
I hear the competition is brutal.
You seem to be enjoying that more than usual.
The feeling was mutual.
Tom was pronounced dead on arrival.
You don't need Tom's money or his approval.
I want to be a role model.
That's how I feel.
It's time you knew how I feel.
I don't know how I feel.
That's the way I feel.
I don't like the way it makes me feel.
I can feel everything you feel.
Tom got out of the car, but Mary remained behind the wheel.
Take the wheel.
Let me take the wheel.
Tom sat down behind the steering wheel.
Tom peered down the tunnel.
This is like shooting ducks in a barrel.
A bus pulled up in front of the hotel.
I'm not going to fight a duel.
I've already posted your bail.
I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in jail.
You'll die in jail.
If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll end up in jail.
Tom will end up in jail.
I'll visit you in jail.
Let it go to voicemail.
I'll take this trail.
Don't leave out a single detail.
Tom is a tricky little devil.
I want to be a daredevil.
Tom wasn't late after all.
I just want to get my daughter back safely, that's all.
That's not good at all.

I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
Tom has no manners at all.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
We won't be talking about that at all.
I never heard Tom say anything to Mary at all.
Tom remembered it all.
It's a pleasure to meet you all.
I can make a call.
I need you to make a phone call.
You get one phone call.
This isn't a social call.
This is your wake-up call.
That's Tom's call.
I don't think that's the right call.
Tom made a bad judgment call.
Tom continued walking down the hall.
I don't remember Tom being so tall.
Hey, get away from the wall.
Tom stuck a poster on the wall.
Tom smashed a champagne glass against the wall.
Tom looked through the small window in the door to see who had rung the doorbell.
Tom is in a holding cell.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
It's really hard to tell.
I don't have any more jokes to tell.
I don't have any more jokes left to tell.
It was a job done well.
Tom remembered Mary quite well.
This isn't going well.
The meeting seemed to go well.
That seemed to go well.
Tom knows this isn't going to go well.
Tom could dance rather well.
I taught you well.
It went extremely well.
Tom isn't looking very well.
Most of Tom's friends know that he doesn't speak French very well.
I guess you know me pretty well.
I do pretty well.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom held out his cup for a refill.
That's a buzz kill.
Tom ran on the treadmill.
Our taxi pulled up outside a place called Chuck's Bar and Grill.
You'll need to hold still.
Tom lay perfectly still.
If I don't report it, someone else will.
I just want to do God's will.
Tom left you everything he had in his will.
Do with it what you will.
We're ready to roll.
Tom put me on the payroll.
It was half full.
Tom tried to play it cool.
It sounds really cool.
That seems pretty cool.
Tom made you look like a fool.
Don't play me for a fool.
Tom is playing you for a fool.
I think we should send Tom to a private school.
Tom was horrible to me in high school.
I used to beat Tom up in high school.
I was the student body president in high school.
Some kids cut through my yard on their way to school.
Tom disappeared after school.
You said I should work harder at school.
We're about to go out on patrol.
Tom does seem to be in control.
I finally feel like everything's under control.
I think we got it under control.
Can you imagine a blue Ferrari?
I'm buying my watch in that shop there.
Gate closes 20 minutes before departure.
Tom was embarrassed when he took his shirt off in front of Mary for the first time, because he had his ex's name tatooed on his chest.
Give me a minute to think about it.
No one would survive that amount of blood loss.
Tom told Mary that he had feelings for her.
We're all capable of exercising self-control.
Tom showed me a picture of his mother as a schoolgirl.
Give it a whirl.
It's disgraceful.
We have many reasons to be hopeful.
I was hoping for something a little more useful.
I'm so grateful.
Tom was grateful.
They were ungrateful.
I don't want to appear ungrateful.
They are so beautiful.
I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful.
God, you're beautiful.
Black is beautiful.
It's astonishingly beautiful.
That would be less painful.
I was hoping for something a little more helpful.
You've been most helpful.
Tom was quite successful.
That was very hurtful.
I've decided to stay where I am.
No one is more determined than I am.
You're even dumber than I am.
I'm not going to change who I am.
I just wish I could remember who I am.
I don't seem to remember who I am.
It's just the way I am.
I don't know how to say how sorry I really am.
It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
It sounds like a scam.
That sounds like a scam.
You two will work as a team.
Take one for the team.
You're part of our team.
I heard that you bought a hockey team.
I needed to blow off some steam.
This might all be a sham.
This might be all a sham.
Their marriage is a sham.
I don't need a cardiogram.
We're particularly interested in your music program.
I'm not what I seem.
I know how hopeless things can seem.
I have very low self-esteem.
You must have dropped them.
Someone must have planted them.
Tom believed them.
That's why I like them.
They want everything right now that you said you'd give them.
Don't take any notice of them.
Tom was one of them.
Tom is the only one capable of stopping them.
We're not at war with them.
We're cuter than them.
I don't want to get too close to them.
They didn't know what was happening to them.
Tom and Mary were thrilled to bits when their daughter took her first steps.
Hang on to them.
Tom and Mary were speaking loud enough for John to hear them.
Tom and Mary were speaking loud enough for John to overhear them.
We buy the cattle and slaughter them.
Tom glared at them.
I've learned to trust them.
I was told you had some news about them.
You're better off without them.
I felt threatened by them.
If we don't have a solution, the least we can do is acknowledge that there's a problem.
I'm not sure I see that as a problem.
Tom clearly has a problem.
I don't find it a problem.
It wasn't a maintenance problem.
I think you're overstating the problem.
I assume this is the problem.
Tom was stumped by the problem.
I'm really starting to worry that you've got a hearing problem.
There is an additional problem.
If they lied about that, we've got a much bigger problem.
There's a logical answer to every problem.
You're a victim of the system.
You've got rhythm.
Tom was there for me when I really needed him.
Tom started to say something, but Mary shushed him.
We think you can tell us where to find him.
Tom had his hands cuffed behind him.
Tom stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.
I'm sure I've never heard of him.
Tom's curiosity got the better of him.
Tom has got his whole life in front of him.
Nobody remembers seeing him.
Tell Tom not to hate me for leaving him.
Tom has something we want, so we need to find something he wants that we can trade with him.
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
I want Tom to know I've got no beef with him.
Tom wants to know what to do with all the stuff you left with him.
Find Tom and kill him.
Tom had plenty of fight left in him.
Tom motioned for Mary to join him.
I can sell it to him.
Tom knows there's only one choice for him.
I find it difficult to tell Tom I miss him.
Tom was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
You'll know him when you meet him.
Tom took to drinking after his wife left him.
Tom probably never knew what hit him.
If Tom doesn't surrender, shoot him.
I knew there was something familiar about him.
Tom said I wasn't to worry about him.
Tom ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
Tom was the third victim.
Tom loves to play the victim.
There's just no way to get Tom to swim.
I must be calm.
I just need to stay calm.
We're not here to talk about music, Tom.
It's not authentic, Tom.
This one's got me worried, Tom.
Tell me you understand, Tom.
I can be your friend, Tom.
I'm not the one looking for a girlfriend, Tom.
Leave it be, Tom.
Get out of my face, Tom.
This isn't your kind of place, Tom.
It wasn't your choice, Tom.
You never had a chance, Tom.
This is your one chance, Tom.
We're on the same side, Tom.
You've lived a charmed life, Tom.
You saved my marriage, Tom.
You have me at a disadvantage, Tom.
Don't ride the brake, Tom.
I hope you find our quarters comfortable, Tom.
Girls aren't worth the trouble, Tom.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Don't make a liar out of me, Tom.
You can't control me, Tom.
Come out and talk to me, Tom.
You can't protect everybody all the time, Tom.
I'm only going to ask you this one time, Tom.
You're the one who wanted me to come, Tom.
This isn't your home, Tom.
You're a strange one, Tom.
I'm putting my foot down on this one, Tom.
I owe you one, Tom.
This may not go as smoothly as you hope, Tom.
You're on pretty shaky ground here, Tom.
That's not why I called you in here, Tom.
You have a very impressive operation here, Tom.
You've done remarkable things here, Tom.
You're missing my point here, Tom.
Help me out here, Tom.
You've lost me there, Tom.
You sure have a way with words there, Tom.
This way please, Tom.
Get off your high horse, Tom.
You're digging your own grave, Tom.
You might want to reconsider that move, Tom.
I've come to say goodbye, Tom.
They'll promise you anything, Tom.
That's good thinking, Tom.
Stop sniveling, Tom.
You should be smiling, Tom.
I'm ready and willing, Tom.
That's very amusing, Tom.
Thanks so much for coming here to help me with my speech, Tom.
I don't think that matters much, Tom.
You've still got the touch, Tom.
You'll need your strength, Tom.
Don't make me shoot you in the back, Tom.
Dial it back, Tom.
You're into this up to your neck, Tom.
You're going to have your hands full, Tom.
Get with the program, Tom.
We'll have to check every one of them, Tom.
You're holding too much in, Tom.
Don't rub it in, Tom.
It sounds like you're home free again, Tom.
We'll be together again, Tom.
I don't want to lose you again, Tom.
This is one you can't win, Tom.
Get your clothes on, Tom.
Don't run yourself down, Tom.
Dial it down, Tom.
Tell me you remember, Tom.
Well, you certainly have a lot to offer, Tom.
Listen to your father, Tom.
Don't sass your father, Tom.
You really are a smooth talker, Tom.
Don't be a party pooper, Tom.
You have a lot to answer for, Tom.
You're impossible to find a gift for, Tom.
I admire your scruples, Tom.
We've been down this road too many times, Tom.
Stay on your toes, Tom.
I just tell it like it is, Tom.
We'll figure out another way out of this, Tom.
I don't see where you're going with this, Tom.
You know you don't have to do this, Tom.
I'm going to get you for this, Tom.
You haven't been returning my calls, Tom.
You taught me always to face my fears, Tom.
You've been in a coma for three years, Tom.
You have your orders, Tom.
Give me the other set of keys, Tom.
You look like you're doing just great, Tom.
You already know the answer to that, Tom.
You're holding me too tight, Tom.
Fake it till you make it, Tom.
Everybody down here sure likes you a lot, Tom.
You're all heart, Tom.
We meet at last, Tom.
That's what we're trying to figure out, Tom.
Knock yourself out, Tom.
I don't see why you're freaking out, Tom.
That's what I love about you, Tom.
I can see right through you, Tom.
God be with you, Tom.
I have every confidence in you, Tom.
Nobody's going to do anything to you, Tom.
Don't let it get to you, Tom.
Don't make me come after you, Tom.
God has a plan for you, Tom.
We've been looking all over for you, Tom.
I've got real bad news for you, Tom.
I have good news for you, Tom.
I'm very concerned about you, Tom.
I've always cared about you, Tom.
Everyone was right about you, Tom.
Get over here right now, Tom.
We don't have all day, Tom.
You don't want to mess with me today, Tom.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
Have it your own way, Tom.
It doesn't have to be this way, Tom.
It doesn't work that way, Tom.
You've done admirably, Tom.
You handled that badly, Tom.
You're not getting away from me that easily, Tom.
We can tell you're not a bad guy, Tom.
I knew I should've married Tom.
The girls all liked Tom.
You're the guy who killed Tom.
I assume this is what killed Tom.
That's the person they suspect killed Tom.
Tell us why you killed Tom.
The person in charge was named Tom.
All I can tell you is it had something to do with a guy named Tom.
How do I know you haven't already harmed Tom?
We should not have angered Tom.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
I just know I wouldn't have missed Tom.
I can see why you suspected Tom.
It makes me wonder how much you really loved Tom.
Somebody might've followed Tom.
The police have no grounds to hold Tom.
This is between me and Tom.

We'll do everything in our power to find Tom.
I think I know how to find Tom.

Show us where you found Tom.

You were the last person to see Tom.
You may have been the last person to see Tom.

That's why I like Tom.

You're the only one who can save Tom.
I think it's about time we started to believe Tom.
That's how I know you love Tom.
Get your filthy hands off Tom.
If it means that much to you, I'll get rid of Tom.
You've ruined the best chance we had to get rid of Tom.

It's important to me what you think of Tom.
That was very thoughtful of Tom.
There's still no sign of Tom.
The bartender set a drink in front of Tom.
The waiter set a coffee cup in front of Tom.
Anything you have to say, you can say in front of Tom.

That's all I can get out of Tom.
That was the last I saw of Tom.
That's the last we saw of Tom.

I've seen what happens to anyone who opposes Tom.
The person we need to tell now is Tom.
That's what everybody calls Tom.
This directly concerns Tom.
You're just afraid you'll have to kiss Tom.
I don't think anyone suspected you weren't Tom.
People stopped and stared at Tom.
Everyone is still staring at Tom.
The guards are aiming their weapons at Tom.
Somebody took a shot at Tom.
I've seen how well you treat Tom.
You have no reason to doubt Tom.
This doesn't seem to affect Tom.
You've got to respect Tom.
They're here to protect Tom.
I think I want to meet Tom.
We're about to meet Tom.
Well, I didn't exactly meet Tom.
We'd better go in there and get Tom.
You just want to get Tom.
In a way, I'm glad I never met Tom.
I didn't plan to hit Tom.
You were the one who suggested I visit Tom.
You should consult Tom.
It's not my job to confront Tom.
Someone has to confront Tom.
The guards are going to shoot Tom.
I can't believe we were going to shoot Tom.
Everyone is seated at the table except Tom.
It breaks my heart that I can't comfort Tom.
It's our duty to support Tom.
Maybe I hurt Tom.
This is going to hurt Tom.
There are those who wish to hurt Tom.
I'm not the one that wants to hurt Tom.
I swear I never hurt Tom.
I still don't think we've seen the last Tom.
The last thing in the world I want to do is arrest Tom.
There's no concrete evidence against Tom.
The tide is turning against Tom.
I've seen what happens to anyone who goes up against Tom.
We can file charges against Tom.
I wouldn't bet against Tom.
You can't force me to testify against Tom.
It couldn't be anyone else but Tom.
I don't think it's fair to single out Tom.
I know you've always cared about Tom.
It's a pity you didn't know more about Tom.
I can't remember anything else about Tom.
That's the most irritating thing about Tom.
We simply don't know anything about Tom.
We're done talking about Tom.
I was so wrong about Tom.
It seems I was wrong about Tom.
I'm still not sure how I feel about Tom.
I have some information about Tom.
Look, what we have to worry about is what we're going to do about Tom.
There's something oddly familiar about Tom.
There's something awfully familiar about Tom.
We've all said nice things about Tom.
They were asking questions about Tom.
I'm not upset about Tom.
I have a theory about Tom.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
The neighborhood won't be the same without Tom.
It's going to be hard to live without Tom.
They're not going to make a move without Tom.
I think you're better off without Tom.
School isn't going to be as much fun without Tom.
It's going to be quiet without Tom.
This place would fall apart without Tom.
Do your best without Tom.
There were times I would've been lost without Tom.
Life would be empty without Tom.
You didn't see this one coming, did you, Tom?
I have faith in you, Tom.
We were driving down the road when we saw Tom.
I'm not sure I want to get to know Tom.
I'll run it by Tom.
That message was sent by Tom.
If it's a boy, I want to name the baby Tom.
We might need the extra room.
Tom entered the room.
The conversation ended abruptly when Tom entered the room.
Tom glanced round the room.
Tom stepped inside the room.
Tom laughed and walked out of the room.
I was out of the room.
Tom started to laugh and was joined by everyone in the room.
Tom was in the room.
Tom and Mary barricaded themselves in the room.
Tom showed Mary into the room.
Let Tom use my dressing room.
Tom is sleeping on the couch in the living room.
There isn't much room.
Tom will be joining you in the observation room.
Now, why don't we continue this conversation in the other room?
I'll go see if people are having fun in the other room.
Your fingerprints were all over Tom's room.
There's a lot of tension in this room.
There may be something in the next room.
There may be somebody in the next room.
Tom glanced round the bedroom.
I have to use the bathroom.
I have to use the restroom.
That's why I suggested that we build a playroom.
I had no idea where it came from.
I know where it came from.
I know where I come from.
I'd like to know who that phone call was from.
Nobody really knows where it comes from.
Tom, this isn't something you can run away from.
I want this building searched from top to bottom.
Tom touched my arm.
You've done enough harm.
We mean Tom no harm.
It'll work like a charm.
You're my good luck charm.
Tom served a three-year prison term.
They were firm.
I'm the office manager of a small law firm.
Tom is wearing what looks like a military uniform.
Spare me the sarcasm.
I didn't mean that as a criticism.
Tom is at the podium.
Tom did the bare minimum.
I couldn't afford to get you a new drum.
I'm going to hit the gym.
I'll continue here as long as I can.
I'll continue working here as long as I can.
I'd like to get Tom ready as soon as we can.
Let's salvage what we can.
Tom was spotted running east on Park Street, followed by a dark sedan.
I need to come clean.
I think it's time to come clean.
The boat was clean.
I don't know what I mean.
It's obvious that Tom is a skilled musician.
Tom is an excellent physician.
You're the historian.
It sounds like a plan.
That sounds like a plan.
It's a plan.
That's part of the plan.
Tom wasn't real receptive to the plan.
Maybe Tom wasn't sticking with the original plan.
I'm glad to see everything's going according to plan.
We had a master plan.
We're going to go with your plan.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
Tom looks every inch a gentleman.
I'm an old woman.
You need a good woman.
I just met the most amazing woman.
Tom applied for a job as a saleswoman.
Tom lost his job as a used car salesman.
Tom is a respectable businessman.
You're quite a craftsman.
They are almost human.
Tom was an artilleryman.
We're at war with Japan.
We're not at war with Japan.
I'm taking the minivan.
I don't know what's got into you all of a sudden.
It was a little sudden.
Tom and Mary were nowhere to be seen.
Tom is still nowhere to be seen.
I'm not too encouraged by what I've seen.
Tom is nowhere to been seen.
This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen.
That's the worst mug shot I've ever seen.
I've been on my own since I was thirteen.
I told you that my dad died when I was thirteen.
You're such a drama queen.
We'll be dining in the kitchen.
I guess I'll catch Tom later then.
Tom sat in the chair to have his picture taken.
You're sadly mistaken.
Tom is no spring chicken.
Tom reported his car stolen.
I want to see if I can find out what happened to those men.
They were all strong men.
This is a product for men.
These are dangerous men.
I just never will understand women.
Tom, there are people who think that you murdered these women.
I have the worst luck with women.
I'm not one of those men who hates women.
The door was kicked open.
The window was wide open.
Tom wants everything out in the open.
If you have a problem with me, let's get it out in the open.
Don't go out into the open.
The heavy door swung open.
Let's see if we can pry this door open.
Come in, it's open.
The rear gate was open.
Let's get it open.
I won't let anything bad happen.
If people get scared enough, anything could happen.
I should've anticipated that this would happen.
This is what'll happen.
Tom looked around as if waiting for something to happen.
This is what's going to happen.
Well, it's not going to happen.
Don't worry, it's not going to happen.
This is really going to happen.
That's a disaster waiting to happen.
Tom was an accident waiting to happen.
This place is an accident waiting to happen.
Nothing has to happen.
I couldn't allow that to happen.
We can make this happen.
We can't stand by and let this happen.
I could make that happen.
I could really make that happen.
I guess our job is not to let that happen.
I had to consider what might happen.
I just want it to actually happen.
Most men I meet aren't interested in children.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
In case something goes wrong, please take care of my children.
Tom never cried, no matter how badly he was beaten.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Tom leaned down to listen.
I didn't say this was heaven.
That's got to be a good sign.
I guess that's a good sign.
That's usually a good sign.
I have some checks for Tom to sign.
I'm impressed by your design.
Tom must not be permitted to resign.
I've been under considerable pressure to resign.
Tom talked his daughter out of marrying John.
Tom probably didn't think it was likely that Mary would fall in love with John.
Tom has already checked in.
Tom is all tucked in.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I won't let Tom come in.
You must come in.
That's where you come in.
I'll pay the price for what I believe in.
You've given me nothing to believe in.
You should turn yourself in.
Anyone could just walk in.
Tom paused to let it sink in.
Just let Tom in.
You should turn in.
They want me to go in.
Tom let me sleep in.
I can get us in.
Tom is doing his best to fit in.
Extensive rainfall is expected throughout the region.
Tom was feeling on top of the world after getting a promotion.
That's how Tom got in.
The last thing I want to do is butt in.
I can get you in.
You wouldn't have come if you didn't think there was something to gain.
Tom nodded again.
Tom whistled again.
Tom screamed again.
The door opened again.
Tom sneezed again.
Don't you ever slap Tom around again.
Tom is full of confidence again.
I'd feel happier if you three went outside again.
Tom spoke again.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
You must not fail me again.
Someone may try to kill me again.
Tom has lied to me again.
Tom has done it to me again.
I don't want to see you down here again.
We had intended never to go there again.
Tom might not want to get too close again.
You're being negative again.
You're showing off again.
I won't blow you off again.
Tom is just crying wolf again.
Tom's right eye is twitching again.
I'd like to get this working again.
I can prevent that from happening again.
I had that dream again.
I never laid eyes on Tom again.
The music began again.
Tom never turned up again.
We'll be together again.
I don't want to lose you ever again.
I read it over again.
Tom opened his eyes again.
Tom closed his eyes again.
Tom shut his eyes again.
I'm going to read this again.
Let's try this again.
Tom went upstairs again.
It's a pleasure to have you with us again.
Tom never wore that hat again.
I suppose we won't meet again.
All is quiet again.
I'm not having this fight again.
You'll see it again.
I should've known I'd never see it again.
I'm delighted to see you again.
I couldn't bear to lose you again.
I don't ever want to lose you again.
Look, I'm not going to tell you again.
I'll be back in an hour to check on you again.
Let me know when you want to get underway again.
Tom became angry again.
Tom gave Mary a key on a silver chain.
Somebody's yanking my chain.
Look, I can explain.
I don't think we have anything to explain.
You're getting to be a pain.
I really hate to see you in such pain.
Tom is crouched on the floor, writhing in pain.
Suddenly, Tom grabbed his chest in pain.
I have a low threshold for pain.
Tom rubbed his leg in obvious pain.
Tom is gritting his teeth in obvious pain.
Tom sought shelter from the rain.
I'm racking my brain.
I don't think I'm cut out to be captain.
You've got to be certain.
I've been eating protein.
Tom, maybe you would like to begin.
Let the games begin.
Tom rubbed his chin.
We're stretched a little thin.
They were thin.
Tom is doodling on a cocktail napkin.
Tom blew his nose into his napkin.
Tom would say anything to save his own skin.
Tom is just trying to get under your skin.
Tom nearly jumped out of his skin.
Tom is getting under my skin.
Tom played you like a violin.
You're guilty as sin.
There's no way of telling who'll win.
I can't believe you let Tom win.
You better win.
I'll try to be a better dad to you from here on.
Tom bought some land to build a house on.
Try to hang on.
Tom felt a headache coming on.
I don't have anything going on.
I'm telling you something's going on.
See what's going on.
I'd like to stick around and find out what's going on.
I'll let you know what's going on.
Tom is clearly upset by what's going on.
So much is going on.
Tom is beginning to catch on.
The party's back on.
The ceiling fan is on.
I really don't care what went on.
I'll have everyone call me Tom from now on.
You will be looking after Tom from now on.
I don't have anyone else to rely on.
We value your opinion.
Tom isn't alone in this opinion.
It's a special occasion.
Tom will need some persuasion.
I think you might need to make a decision.
I'd like to hear your decision.
I'm waiting for your decision.
I await your decision.
Tom had every right to make that decision.
I need it to be my decision.
I'm quite comfortable with my decision.
I just had a vision.
Tom doesn't require much supervision.
We need a diversion.
Tom suffered from depression.
I think I made a good impression.
I see you made a good impression.
Tom didn't want to give the wrong impression.
I make a horrible first impression.
It could be a dangerous mission.
I figured it was better not to do anything without your permission.
I could've done this without your permission.
You have a nasty concussion.
I know you're on vacation.
I've never seen such dedication.
Tom isn't on any medication.
There's been a complication.
It's an ongoing investigation.
I'm trying to conduct an investigation.
I had a revelation.
There might have been a miscalculation.
This is only a simulation.
I've got inside information.
I just received some very disturbing information.
They were collecting information.
Tom gave us some useful information.
Now, all I need is information.
Just don't volunteer any new information.
I'd like to ask you for an explanation.
The boss asked for Tom's resignation.
They're all figments of your imagination.
I'll use my imagination.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
You could've jeopardized the entire operation.
Tom said that it would be a simple rescue operation.
Come on, Tom, I need a little cooperation.
Tom looks like he's had an inspiration.
You were my inspiration.
Tom is losing his concentration.
Tom isn't good at making conversation.
I'm shocked you could make such an accusation.
Tom sold his car without hesitation.
Tom has just been given an invitation.
I can't believe you missed Tom's graduation.
Tom is trying to make the best of a bad situation.
Tom's very much in control of the situation.
We're on top of the situation.
I don't really think that you're helping the situation.
Let's be calm and consider the situation.
We're in the middle of a delicate situation.
We sympathize with your situation.
Tom has his doubts about this situation.
Tom is now in a very difficult situation.
I've got what looks like an emergency situation.
I can make a reservation.
Take evasive action.
You had a perfectly normal reaction.
Tom could barely hide his reaction.
I can see how that might be your first reaction.
I won't give them the satisfaction.
I think Tom won the election.
I could never win an election.
Tom couldn't calculate the price of the collection.
I thought we had a real connection.
Everyone in the room looked in Tom's direction.
Perhaps you could point us in the right direction.
Tom didn't think he needed protection.
Let's just say it's for your own protection.
It's for your protection.
You're under my protection.
I don't see it as a contradiction.
Tom had no ambition.
I have a skin condition.
I know about your condition.
Tom got in the truck and turned the key in the ignition.
You know my position.
You just bought yourself another day of detention.
I can see why that caught your attention.
That's why you got the promotion.
That's an amusing notion.
You have a visitor in reception.
I can see how you might have that misconception.
Maybe it's a question of perception.
Thank you for giving me the option.
That was never an option.
Letting Tom go wasn't an option.
Staying here isn't an option.
That's hardly an option.
Tom was put up for adoption.
Don't blow things out of proportion.
That's not a question.
Tom sidestepped the question.
Tom kindly answered the question.
A plea bargain is out of the question.
Tom didn't quite know how to respond to the question.
Tom needs to answer the question.
Tom was a little surprised by the question.
Let me ask Tom a simple question.
I could ask you the same question.
That's a mighty fine question.
It was a legitimate question.
That's a really provocative question.
I have just one small question.
Your sanity isn't in question.
I believe that answers your question.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
I'm done with this question.
I'm not in a position to answer that question.
Tom couldn't resist asking Mary that question.
Perhaps we should ask a different question.
Tom proceeded to the next question.
Tom nodded in response to my question.
That seems to be a sensible precaution.
We have an elegant solution.
I'm glad we already have so much in common.
It's barely noon.
I'm taking my boat out this afternoon.
It was a great afternoon.
I have a meeting with Tom tomorrow afternoon.
Everyone hopes the recession will end soon.
Your time will come soon.
It'll wear off soon.
Don't worry, you'll get your voice back soon.
Tom didn't come too soon.
You'll be one of us soon.
We'll have you back here very soon.
I have a feeling you'll be going very soon.
Tom looked for a weapon.
Maybe you should give me that weapon.
Tom had always wanted a son.
I think Tom would be a good name for our son.
Tom told me he had information on your son.
I want to be a father to your son.
Tom embraced his son.
You said Tom loved his son.
Tom couldn't find his son.
Tom was friends with my son.
Get away from my son.
I don't like to smile unless I have a reason.
I brought you here for a reason.
Tell me there's a reason.
Tom might have done the right thing for the wrong reason.
That isn't a good enough reason.
That's not a good enough reason.
I thought you had another reason.
It'd be treason.
I'm placing you under arrest for treason.
It's now planting season.
I know Tom will eventually get out of prison.
They've both been released from prison.
Tom wouldn't last a month in prison.
I think Tom is still in prison.
I want to make sure people like you end up in prison.
You're going back to prison.
I won't go back to prison.
Tom went to prison.
We're charging you with the murder of Tom Jackson.
The name on the card is Tom Jackson.
I've always felt more like a tiger than a person.
You're a very privileged person.
Tom isn't a stable person.
I'm a people person.
You're a very perceptive person.
You're a strong person.
You're an evil person.
Tom isn't a truthful person.
I can tell you're a warm person.
Tom is just an ordinary person.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.
I want to prove to you I've learned my lesson.
The truth is I've always liked Boston.
If I were you, I would quit my job and leave Boston.
It's Tom calling from Boston.
I'm planning on getting a job in Boston.
I went home and told my wife about the job in Boston.
You're finished in Boston.
Tom's friend is getting married in Boston.
Tom bragged about what happened in Boston.
Tom is stationed in Boston.
I have a wife back home in Boston.
Tom returned to his home in Boston.
I'm not ready to run a car dealership in Boston.
Tom and I partied together one night last year in Boston.
We met after your show the other night in Boston.
Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you can tell me about the time you spent in Boston.
I need you in Boston.
I think I have about enough time to get the train to Boston.
It's not like I really want to go to Boston.
Tom disapproved of my trip to Boston.
We've got a charter flight waiting to take us to Boston.
We're trying to get to Boston.
Tom took a commercial flight to Boston.
Tom, I need you on the next flight to Boston.
We picked a hitchhiker up on the way to Boston.
We're halfway to Boston.
Tom used to ask me so many questions about Boston.
Tom put some change into the vending machine and punched a button.
Tom pushed the speaker phone button.
My biggest problem will be deciding what to do with all the money I just won.
Tom feigned concern.
Tom and Mary exchanged a look of concern.
That's of no concern.
Your safety isn't our concern.
My relationship with Tom isn't your concern.
I'm going to make Tom wish he'd never been born.
This is no time to be stubborn.
We need time to mourn.
I don't know where else to turn.
I have nowhere else to turn.
I don't have anywhere else to turn.
I want something in return.
I may not return.
That's part of the fun.
You used to be so much fun.
I wish you didn't look like you were having so much fun.
You've had your fun.
Let Tom have his fun.
Being a policeman isn't any fun.
The guy had a gun.
I've never even touched a gun.
I don't wear a gun.
We have them on the run.
We'll be better off in the long run.
Tom tried to run.
Tom started to run.
You better run.
You will be on your own.
I think you need to figure this out on your own.
I think you've got to work this out on your own.
I'm told that Tom likes to work on his own.
Tom's personal life is his own.
I've been doing some calculations of my own.
I don't know how I'd survive on my own.
The laughter died down.
I think Tom has calmed down.
I heard that Tom was gunned down.
The car slowed down.
I let my guard down.
I need you to keep your voice down.
Tom knows I'm not the type to settle down.
You wore me down.
You're bringing me down.
I don't want those guys hunting me down.
I'm supposed to track someone down.
Pipe down.
Put the bag down.
Tom feared falling down.
Tom isn't about to back down.
Tom wouldn't back down.
I think a drink would help me calm down.
I think we need to all calm down.
I think everybody should try to calm down.
We're trying to track Tom down.
I'm closing this operation down.
Tom put his glass down.
They turned us down.
That's how it went down.
I'm putting my foot down.
I'm going to put my foot down.
I feel like I let you down.
The fuse is blown.
We'll begin a systematic search of the town.
We're the talk of the town.
The circus is in town.
Tom Jackson practically built this town.
I'm going to drop you off downtown.
Tom has got more restraint than I do.
You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
You need sleep as much as I do.
Tom has the same rash as I do.
You know that as well as I do.
It's what I'd do.
There's something we could do.
You know what I think we should do.
It's not what we do.
I think that'll do.
I guess that'll do.
Never tell the truth when a lie will do.
There's only one thing I can do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
Tom knows there's only one thing he can do.
It's the only thing Tom can do.
I didn't care what I had to do.
Tom realized what he had to do.
The rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened.
He is much older than her.
This is what Tom is supposed to do.
I was prepared to do anything they asked me to do.
It'll have to do.
I guess there's only one thing to do.
I just think it's the right thing to do.
I know it's the right thing to do.
I have literally nothing to do.
I have a lot of gardening to do.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
I already know what I'm going to do.
I've got some photocopying to do.
That's what you're trying to do.
Tom isn't quite ready to do what you're asking him to do.
This isn't an easy thing for Tom to do.
That's what Tom likes to do.
That's not something Tom really wants to do.
I see no reason for us to do what Tom told us to do.
You're in no position to tell me what to do.
We don't need Tom telling us what to do.
We were hoping you could tell us what to do.
That's exactly the kind of thing I don't want to do.
Do what your heart tells you to do.
That'll never do.
That's what I always do.
There's a price on my head for a murder I didn't do.
When we were younger, there was nothing that we couldn't do.
Tom loves everything you do.
I don't want to talk to Tom any more than you do.
I've never seen anyone enjoy reading as much as you do.
We care for Tom as much as you do.
Tom doesn't kiss nearly as well as you do.
I have no control over what you do.
Tom clicked the remote to stop the video.
I'm going to give it a go.
It's too late for me, but you could go.
You need to let this one go.
Of course Tom will go.
I never should've let Tom go.
I can't believe you just let Tom go.
Just let the woman go.
Tom turned to go.
I didn't ask whether you wanted to go.
We're good to go.
I assume we're free to go.
Look, I have to go.
There's nowhere for Tom to go.
You're clear to go.
I'll see to it that you get to go.
The party's over. You've got to go.
That's not the way to go.
We better go.
You better go.
OK, people, let's go.
You know how these things go.
Something told me you wouldn't let this go.
I let it go.
We're letting you go.
That's why we let you go.
I couldn't just let you go.
Tom should've never let Mary go.
You lost me a long time ago.
I needed you a long time ago.
Tom was pretty worked up about an hour ago.
I asked for this thirty minutes ago.
You should have enrolled your children months ago.
Tom died in his sleep three years ago.
Tom isn't what he was three years ago.
Tom's wife died a few years ago.
You're just like Tom was thirty years ago.
You should've been asleep hours ago.
Tom nearly killed himself a few hours ago.
Tom just bought it a couple of days ago.
Tom went missing several days ago.
Tom's parents sent him to Boston because he kept getting into trouble in Chicago.
I gave Tom a coffee mug with our company logo.
Tom sang along with the radio.
Tom turned the dial on the radio.
Tom smiled hello.
Somebody should say hello.
Tom told me I should go, but I said no.
Hey, if that's what you want to do, I'm not going to say no.
Remember, Tom, just say no.
Tom didn't exactly say no.
I still say we should've bought that piano.
Tom is probably dead, too.
Tom laughed, too.
I've been getting a little sunburned, too.
Tom's got a real bad headache, too.
Get me a slice of pie, too.
I know you care about me, too.
I imagine that's what's going to happen the next time, too.
I can only guess that you probably want one, too.
That's what I was wondering, too.

Tom was incredulous.
Tom is delusional and dangerous.
That'd be dangerous.
Tom seems to be dangerous.
It's becoming too dangerous.
It's far too dangerous.
It's way too dangerous.
It's just way too dangerous.
It was incredibly dangerous.
It's said to be very dangerous.
I think that's more than generous.
I think that's really generous.
The climb was strenuous.
It's a little presumptuous.
There's no point in being nervous.
Outsiders make Tom nervous.
Well, I didn't want to make you nervous.
Listen, I got some bad news.
I can cope with bad news.
It's bad news.
I just received some very bad news.
That can't be the good news.
I've just received some good news.
Tell me the news.
Tom was crushed by the news.
Tom delivered the horrible news.
This is stunning news.
I've just received some delightful news.
I have marvelous news.
I've just received some great news.
Tom is boarding up the windows.
Tom is luckier than he knows.
I don't know how Tom knows.
We aren't due to arrive for three days.
I'll have it in a couple days.
All I need is three more days.
Tom wasn't too happy in those days.
You've had a real hard time the last couple of days.
You're out of vacation days.
Tom has been lying for days.
It went on for days.
Tom went on a trip for a few days.
We're only asking you to do it for a few days.
That should give us another few days.
Tom'll say what he always says.
Tom fumbled in his pocket for the keys.
I realized I still had your keys.
Tom fumbled with his keys.
They sent me three turkeys.
We don't stand a chance against those guys.
I've had it up to here with you guys.
Tom wants to give an answer, but of course, he can't.
Tom started to say something, but didn't.
I'd like to say it's been fun working here, but it hasn't.
Tom was sneered at.
I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
Tom suddenly understood what Mary was getting at.
I'm not sure what Tom is getting at.
Tom shivered when he saw the black cat.
We could all use something to eat.
You can bring us all back something to eat.
Tom was hoping to earn enough to buy something to eat.
We've been waiting thirty minutes to eat.
We're trying to find ourselves something decent to eat.
In all the excitement, I forgot to eat.
I'm not a deadbeat.
Tom isn't about to admit defeat.
That'd be great.
I'm telling you this is going to be great.
This is working great.
Just relax, Tom, you're doing great.
I think you've been doing great.
The emotional price is too great.
That must've felt so great.
The chicken was great.
Saving lives feels great.
It feels great.
It feels pretty great.
I hope you've found a seat.
Tom smiled as he took his seat.
Tom leaped from his seat.
Tom hopped in the front seat.
Tom is in the copilot seat.
Tom hopped in the backseat.
Tom shoved Mary into the backseat.
Tom is working up a sweat.
I never would've guessed that.
Tom approved that.
I guess I deserved that.
Somebody somewhere must've said that.
I guess I just realized how stupid I would look if I did that.
You'd make her the happiest woman on earth if you did that.
You can work around that.
It can't be that.
Anyone could see that.
I'm sorry you had to see that.
I don't know how I didn't see that.
I think we can manage that.
I don't know how we're going to manage that.
I can arrange that.
I can't make a guarantee like that.
Tom, you don't have to talk to me like that.
Tom doesn't usually talk to me like that.
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.
Don't you start talking like that.
You know I can't answer a question like that.
I wish I could drop off to sleep like that.
It was like that.
I think Tom is like that.
I don't think it works like that.
We aren't like that.
They aren't like that.
I hadn't thought of it like that.
I never really thought of it like that.
Girls don't ordinarily like that.
I do wish Tom would stop calling me that.
I suspect you've already done that.
I bet you tell everyone that.
I can appreciate that.
I can certainly appreciate that.
It's hard to believe that there are still those who believe that.
I believe you believe that.
I don't think there's much chance of that.
Surely Tom is aware of that.
Tom knows me by sight, I'm sure of that.
You have no proof of that.
That's enough of that.
I don't know what made me think of that.
I don't like the look of that.
I'm not too certain of that.
You don't want any part of that.
I'm watching that.
I don't see Tom doing that.
I don't want to discourage you from doing that.
I think I remember doing that.
I hated myself for doing that.
I don't see anybody doing that.
I have a hard time believing that.
I'm not just saying that.
I knew you weren't OK with that.
You can't go public with that.
I'm not concerned with that.
I'm comfortable with that.
I guess you can't help me with that.
I can't compete with that.
Stop playing with that.
I can work with that.
I was cool with that.
There's only one problem with that.
I could never get away with that.
I can see how you might think that.
I can feel that.
We have plenty of time for all that.
I can prevent all that.
I wanted to make sure you told them that.
I can't believe I just promised Tom that.
Try telling Tom that.
I think you'd better tell Tom that.
I think you'd better not tell Tom that.
I really believe you mean that.
It's a little more than that.
Hey, I can't ask for more than that.
It was more than that.
Tom deserves more than that.
It's a lot more than that.
I'm hoping to make stay a little longer than that.
Tom is smarter than that.
You need to be better than that.
You know me better than that.
You deserve much better than that.
Tom knows better than that.
I raised you better than that.
I taught you better than that.
You know better than that.
I'd like to think that there's more to it than that.
You're better than that.
I can't really put a price on that.
I'll stake my reputation on that.
I insist on that.
Tom would do that.
I don't know what made me do that.
Well, in this country you're not allowed to do that.
This isn't the time or the place to do that.
I don't know what possessed me to do that.
You've had more than enough time to do that.
You really shouldn't bother to do that.
Nobody's forcing you to do that.
This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
I couldn't let you do that.
You should totally do that.
I was so looking forward to that.
I don't think it'll come to that.
It's not going to come to that.
We're hoping it doesn't come to that.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
I never found the answer to that.
I'm guessing you already know the answer to that.
Tom will never consent to that.
I saw to that.
I have but one thing to say to that.
I can top that.
You can help stop that.
I'm so sad to hear that.
I needed to hear that.
You didn't need to hear that.
Tom was actually rather relieved to hear that.
Tom gave up on everything after that.
There's no getting over that.
I can answer that.
Perhaps I can answer that.
I never really cared for that.
I thought you'd already been compensated for that.
I could get you arrested for that.
This isn't the time or the place for that.
You're too late for that.
I think it's already too late for that.
I could kick myself for that.
I hated Tom for that.
You can't lock me up for that.
I don't have an answer for that.
I don't think I'm ready for that.
Everybody tells themselves that.
You can't look at that.
I don't know how you can eat that.
I can respect that.
I totally get that.
I think we can accept that.
I thought we were past that.
I must ask you to do just that.
Tom is very excited about that.
Let's see about that.
I feel horrible about that.
Don't tell me you don't know anything about that.
You'd have at ask Tom about that.
I can try to talk to Tom about that.
I know a thing or two about that.
I'm real sorry to hear about that.
We're very curious about that.
Tom is kind of freaked out about that.
Tom has been talking to Mary about that.
I'll worry about that.
You're smooth, I'll give you that.
It's not for me to tell you that.
I'm under no obligation to tell you that.
I wanted to make sure you saw that.
Tom knew that.
I wanted to make sure your family knew that.
Look, I know that.
I should know that.
You're really out of line, you know that.
I don't want to know how you know that.
You never heard me say that.
I most certainly didn't say that.
Tom knows his way around a boat.
Let's get back to the boat.
You really are a spoiled brat.
We're forever in your debt.
I can predict how Tom will react.
Tom and I made a pact.
Let's stay in close contact.
That'd be perfect.
That's actually perfect.
Tom is vital to our project.
Have a little respect.
Show a little respect.
You already have my respect.
I've failed in every respect.
I'm not a suspect.
We have an image to protect.
They were very strict.
Go with your instinct.
You need to sell more product.
Tom is just getting cold feet.
I've got cold feet.
Tom shifted his feet.
Tom has trouble thinking on his feet.
Tom scrambled to his feet.
Tom leaped to his feet.
Tom got to his feet.
I'm used to thinking on my feet.
We need to find another way to make ends meet.
It's a pleasure to finally meet.
Tom didn't look both ways before crossing the street.
Tom left the building and walked down the street.
The less I know, the more interested I get.
I don't know how much worse this'll get.
I know how overwhelming it can all get.
I only wanted to forget.
Tom says he drinks to forget.
It's a trip I won't forget.
It's dead quiet.
It's almost too quiet.
The floor is quiet.
The house seemed strangely quiet.
The house is very quiet.
I chartered a jet.
I'll take the jacket.
You might want to lose the dinner jacket.
Tom removed his jacket.
There's no way I'm going to pay for your ticket.
Tom pulled an envelope out of his pocket.
Tom searched in his pocket.
Tom paid in cash that he happened to have in his pocket.
Stock prices could skyrocket.
Tom vomited into the bucket.
Tom is sitting on a picnic blanket.
Let's see your wallet.
Tom removed a card from his wallet.
Tom sighed and pulled out his wallet.
That's how we met.
You're the most amazing person I've ever met.
Hi, I'm Tom. I don't think we've ever met.
I don't want you anywhere near the medicine cabinet.
The only way this is going to happen is in secret.
Tom knows his way around a movie set.
I know all the skeletons in your closet.
Tom isn't crying anymore, but he's still obviously still upset.
You had to know Tom might get upset.
You just don't want to get wet.
Tom said that there were others on the island, but I haven't seen anyone else yet.
Well, I wouldn't do that quite yet.
It's too early to tell yet.
I don't think they've found out about Tom yet.
We've received no explanation yet.
It hasn't come up yet.
You haven't seen all the family pictures yet.
I may do it yet.
I don't want to say goodbye just yet.
Don't tell Tom just yet.
Let's not pack our bags just yet.
I don't feel ready for that just yet.
I haven't dismissed you yet.
I'm not finished with you yet.
There's hope for you yet.
That's what I don't know yet.
Tom was in on the theft.
Tom nodded his head and left.
Tom nodded and left.
You've got one minute left.
You have one move left.
There's only one torpedo left.
I don't have many years left.
Tom is the only patient left.
That's your gift.
I'll take the first shift.
I'll take first shift.
I get your drift.
I must be getting soft.
Let's get one thing straight.
Let me get something straight.
Let me make sure I have this straight.
OK, let's see if I've got this straight.
I've been up 36 hours straight.
I never could get that straight.
There's something we have to get straight.
Tom pushed against the door with all his weight.
Tom expected more of a fight.
Tom decided it wasn't really worth the fight.
Tom knows better than to fight.
Tom switched off the light.
Step into the light.
Tom cried out with delight.
I booked us an earlier flight.
This is the house where I lived when I was young.
This is the neighborhood where I lived when I was younger.
This is the neighborhood I lived in when I was younger.
I'm on your flight.
Tom put the traveler up for the night.
We only need shelter for the night.
I could hear you pacing all night.
I'm the one who danced with the kids all night.
Tom has been at it all night.
It's a school night.
I had an awful night.
Tom returned very late at night.
I wasn't even there that night.
Tom said he wasn't even there that night.
We loved what you said last night.
I don't remember that being there last night.
Tom has been working since late last night.
I had that dream again last night.
I understand you and Tom were together last night.
I left my watch on the counter last night.
I thought that you were coming over last night.
I told you everything I knew last night.
Tom looked pretty healthy last night.
I've arranged for a dinner tomorrow night.
There's going to be a press conference tonight.
Let's go on a date tonight.
I'm supposed to have the house to myself tonight.
Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
I still think we should've told your dad where we're going tonight.
I'm waitressing tonight.
Tom sang better than usual tonight.
Tom is flying in tonight.
I don't think we have to worry about anybody showing up tonight.
I'm done for tonight.
I was wondering if I could sleep over at Tom's tonight.
I don't have the energy for this tonight.
We're having TV dinners tonight.
Tom is going to chill with us tonight.
I'm not having dinner with you tonight.
I'd love to come by tonight.
That's Tom on the right.
We need to get this one right.
Let's say for the moment that you're right.
There's nothing worse than being half right.
At least I got something right.
I just want to get this paragraph right.
That's quite all right.
Just pray I'm right.
I thought I'd know when the time was right.
I thought Tom would know when the time was right.
I only need another few days to make things right.
I'm going to make this right.
It feels right.
You have to do that just right.
For once in your life, you're exactly right.
You gave me a fright.
You gave me such a fright.
Tom was out of sight.
Tell your men to stay out of sight.
Tom came in sight.
There was no hope in sight.
Tom is nowhere in sight.
The end is in sight.
Tom will be killed on sight.
I never knew you and Tom were so tight.
I didn't plan on being caught.
I don't plan on getting caught.
Tom is clearly agitated and distraught.
My testimony can't be bought.
You're even dumber than I thought.
It's just as I thought.
I don't know what I thought.
That's a nice thought.
Tom seems to be deep in thought.
Tom was still lost in thought.
Tom is lost in thought.
OK, hold that thought.
That's an ugly thought.
Tom shut the cage and latched it.
I think you liked it.
Someone else must've opened it.
I might have mentioned it.
Tom's cell phone rang and he answered it.
Nobody could've guessed it.
You can't have wanted it.
I've accepted it.
I've already accepted it.
Tom never actually came out and said it.
I can respect why you did it.
I don't know how they're going to avoid it.
I don't think I could stand it.
Tom could hardly stand it.
I'll let you know when I find it.
Tom said I should've been able to find it.
I'm going to find it.
Take it from me, Tom, you'll never find it.
I don't know who's behind it.
We have evidence that Tom was behind it.
That's how I found it.
I want everything replaced just as we found it.
I don't know how Tom stood it.
Tom couldn't face it.
I'm so glad you made it.
Tom's name was on the list with a question mark beside it.
That's the way I see it.
Tom told me he had a right to see it.
You'll never see it.
They can't see it.
If something bad happened, I didn't see it.
I always knew you were going to make it.
I don't think I'm going to make it.
I don't think Tom is going to make it.
Hey, you're not going to make it.
You'll never make it.
I suppose Tom didn't make it.
Trust me, you'll like it.
Don't think I won't like it.
I'm sure you won't like it.
Tom didn't dislike it.
You gave me your word and you broke it.
Now you've done it.
I said ignore it.
Tom is starting to lose it.
Tom said I might lose it.
Give us a chance to investigate it.
You can take it or leave it.
You can't just have it.
I'm beginning to believe it.
I bet I can prove it.
I don't have to prove it.
I'm going to prove it.
I didn't say they deserve it.
I told them to stuff it.
Tom didn't see anything. I made sure of it.
Tom was sure of it.
I hated every minute of it.
Tom is loving every minute of it.
You don't know the half of it.
You'll get the hang of it.
Tom never thought anything of it.
Don't think of it.
I couldn't make head or tail of it.
I'm sure Tom will be able to get to the bottom of it.
There's a mystery here and I want to get to the bottom of it.
That's only part of it.
I don't want any part of it.
That's the last of it.
Make the most of it.
This isn't the worst of it.
I wouldn't make a big deal out of it.
You've taken all the fun out of it.
Leave us out of it.
I just can't get out of it.
I did my best to keep you out of it.
Tom seems really out of it.
Tom is still pretty out of it.
Tom picked up the letter and begins reading it.
Tom couldn't resist touching it.
I hated myself for thinking it.
Tom took a soda from the fridge and started drinking it.
Tom saw that Mary was losing it.
I don't know how you can keep eating it.
You're not getting it.
You don't have to watch it.
This is pretty much it.
I'll talk you through it.
I wish I had a chance to finish it.
Tom was OK with it.
Tom seems OK with it.
I don't know if I can cope with it.
I can live with it.
I'll have to live with it.
You have to live with it.
You'll learn to live with it.
I had to go along with it.
I can't find anything wrong with it.
I'm going to stick with it.
This is my problem and I'm going to deal with it.
They're having fun with it.
I'll run with it.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
I had practically nothing to do with it.
I don't know how Tom put up with it.
I'm vaguely familiar with it.
Do what you want with it.
They're getting away with it.
Tom isn't getting away with it.
Nobody crosses me and gets away with it.
I know it's going to be worth it.
Let's chuck it.
That's not why I took it.
That could explain it.
I'll stake my job on it.
You have my personal word on it.
I give you my word on it.
I'll stake my life on it.
I'm going to put my name on it.
Tell them we're working on it.
Tom looks like he's really concentrating on it.
Buy me another beer and I'll think on it.
I've already put Tom to work on it.
I thought Tom was in on it.
You might want to get in on it.
I'll stake my reputation on it.
That'd do it.
If it was easy, anybody could do it.
This should do it.
I helped other people do it.
That's how we do it.
That's when I'll do it.
I let Tom do it.
Tom isn't too old to do it.
The longer you wait, the harder it's going to be to do it.
I'm not saying we're not going to do it.
You just have to want to do it.
That's the way to do it.
You mean you couldn't do it.
Don't think I won't do it.
OK, let's just do it.
That should about do it.
You would have gotten away with it if Tom hadn't seen you do it.
Don't get too used to it.
I couldn't swear to it.
Let's get to it.
Tom beat you to it.
I saw to it.
Tell them we're looking into it.
Put your backs into it.
I really don't want to get into it.
I never plan anything if I can help it.
I don't know what we can do to stop it.
If there's something I ought to know, I'd like to hear it.
Don't expect me to lose any sleep over it.
I'm saying get over it.
They'll get over it.
I'm completely over it.
There's no need for it.
We paid for it.
We'll wait here for it.
Anyone stupid enough to go there is asking for it.
I almost fell for it.
We're going to have to make a run for it.
You've just got to go for it.
We'll pay you for it.
You were so ready for it.
I suppose that's it.
That's how Tom does it.
That nails it.
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
You were bad at it.
I was good at it.
They're still going at it.
You're going to eat it.
Let me inspect it.
It'll happen again if we don't correct it.
Tom asked for it and he's going to get it.
I think I'm starting to get it.
We should never forget it.
Tom flipped the coin in the air and then caught it.
I didn't expect you to admit it.
Everyone felt it.
Just tell me how you want it.
That's certainly not it.
I'm very much against it.
I know you're up against it.
You've lost it.
I assume you all read about it.
I'm sure you all read about it.
Tom has never talked about it.
I'm very excited about it.
Don't get too relaxed about it.
We should've been told about it.
I feel really good about it.
Tom was very nice about it.
I don't want you even thinking about it.
I never stop thinking about it.
I've got a real good feeling about it.
I look forward to hearing about it.
Let Tom go and we'll talk about it.
I'm not going to talk about it.
Let's hope they don't even think about it.
Don't you even think about it.
You don't even want to think about it.
I guess I didn't really think about it.
Someone should write a book about it.
There's not much Tom can do about it.
Tom is kind of worked up about it.
I guess that's about it.
We were very serious about it.
Don't fret about it.
Tom was a good sport about it.
I'll tell you about it.
Tom said you knew about it.
Tom doesn't have to know about it.
Tom isn't going to know about it.
I can live without it.
This was your big chance, Tom, and you blew it.
I knew you'd blow it.
I don't want to blow it.
Don't tell me you don't know it.
I'll be up and around before you know it.
I need to hear you say it.
I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
That was worth the wait.
You're welcome to wait.
It's going to have to wait.
I could hardly wait.
We should be OK here for a bit.
Just sit there for a bit.
I don't like the sound of that one bit.
I'm a creature of habit.
Tom is a creature of habit.
We're all creatures of habit.
Tom is asking for credit.
It doesn't fit.
I knew I could make it fit.
I don't care about profit.
We think Tom knows more about Mary's death than he's willing to admit.
I'm doing the speed limit.
They've upped my limit.
Tom is going to die in the morning for a crime he didn't commit.
Tom was about to get his learner's permit.
I admire your grit.
I have to say I admire your spirit.
We're more than willing to extend our visit.
It looks like you could use a new suit.
You can imagine how Tom felt.
I feel as good as I've ever felt.
You can imagine how they felt.
If Tom escapes, it'll be your fault.
The rest was my fault.
You made that difficult.
I'm practically an adult.
This is a good result.
Sometimes the most important clues are the ones that seem the most insignificant.
I didn't know what it all meant.
That's very elegant.
I thought you were brilliant.
Tom looked indignant.
We really have to be more tolerant.
Tom seemed reluctant.
Just tell them I'm a consultant.
I think birthdays are important.
Tom realized Mary might be telling him something important.
That's very distant.
I know what's relevant.
I can put it back in the drawer if you want.
You can think that if you want.
Believe anything you want.
They might have what you want.
There is a price for always getting what you want.
They might sell what you want.
I'll kiss you if that's what you want.
I can be exactly what you want.
The ruins are truly magnificent.
I'll be out of jail as soon as the police realize I'm innocent.
They must know I'm innocent.
I've improved my reaction time by almost thirty percent.
Tom met with a traffic accident.
Tom couldn't bring himself to tell Mary about the accident.
Tom's death may not have been an accident.
Tom has been missing since the incident.
That was evident.
I haven't exactly been prudent.
Tom was just a lonely exchange student.
I hope I can be a worthy student.
It wasn't sufficient.
I just had a meeting with the new client.
That's real convenient.
It's a little inconvenient.
Perhaps they thought you were a patient.
Tom was a mental patient.
Tom looked impatient.
Tom felt himself growing impatient.
They became silent.
They were silent.
The crowd fell silent.
Tom fell silent.
Your paper was excellent.
I could never be violent.
They're not all violent.
Tom was disconcerted by the announcement.
This is why I didn't want to make an announcement.
We have a signed divorce agreement.
Tom nodded his head in agreement.
Tom nodded his head to show his agreement.
I'm not trying to back out of that agreement.
They seem to be having a disagreement.
Use your best judgment.
I can live with that arrangement.
They're in their element.
Maybe I'll come out of retirement.
The police will be very interested to learn that you're keeping Tom locked up in the basement.
Tom's eyes twinkle with amusement.
Tom was puzzled by Mary's statement.
I made an error in judgment.
I've always trusted your judgment.
I've always had complete confidence in your judgment.
Tom glanced around in astonishment.
We've received our first assignment.
Tom will be out in a moment.
Tom will join you in a moment.
They chatted for a moment.

That's what I'm here about.
I know exactly the one you're talking about.
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
Tom, this is exactly what we were talking about.

Boy am I glad to see you.
I needed to see you.
That's why I came to see you.
Tom, there's a policeman here to see you.
It's wonderful to see you.
I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
I have an offer to make you.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
I could've been like you.
I need men like you.
There aren't many men like you.
I used to be married to a woman who looked a lot like you.
That's so unlike you.
I knew the truth would scare you.
I wouldn't say that around Tom if I were you.

This may surprise you.

I won't let her have you.

Let's assume for the moment that I believe you.

In time, I'm sure Tom will forgive you.
Buy me a cup of coffee and I might forgive you.
I can drive you.
I could look into it if you want me to.

That's enough out of you.
I'm going to get the truth out of you.
I have no memory of you.
Nobody's forcing you.
Thank you for being you.
I don't like Tom touching you.
That's a question I should be asking you.
That's why I'm asking you.
You can do this, I'm telling you.
This is the last time I'm telling you.
Tom has been misinforming you.
I have so much to teach you.

I'm going to get right back with you.
There's only one problem with you.
I'm choosing to go with you.

I'm not going to play guessing games with you.
We had intended not to meet with you.
I'm going to be straight with you.
The manager will be right with you.
I have to be honest with you.
I haven't been honest with you.
I'm going to be very honest with you.
Tell us what's new with you.
I suppose I should thank you.
That's what I'm here to ask you.
I'm not ashamed to tell you.
This is why I was afraid to tell you.
Boy have I got something to tell you.
I have so much to tell you.
It would be better for them to tell you.
I had to wait to tell you.
These are the things I couldn't tell you.
It'd kill you.
I could kill you.
Give me that or I'll kill you.
If you don't tell us, we'll kill you.
Tom is prepared to kill you.
Tom won't hesitate to kill you.
I need a good reason not to kill you.
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
It'd be a lot more convincing if it came from you.
I don't need a sermon from you.
I need one last favor from you.
I'm not the one who kept secrets from you.
I'm telling you this because I don't want to have any secrets from you.
I want much more than that from you.
Sorry for keeping it secret from you.
That's what I want from you.
I couldn't take money from you.
I don't wish to harm you.

I don't want to alarm you.
I didn't mean to demean you.
Tom has a better work ethic than you.
I'm happier than you.
I can hold my liquor better than you.
I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you.
I have total confidence in you.
I didn't think you had it in you.
Let me entertain you.
The drinks are on you.
I'm not here to put pressure on you.
I checked up on you.
Please don't make me waste a bullet on you.
I used to dream about being married to you.
Tom was nothing compared to you.
I wanted to be a good friend to you.
I know this must seem incredible to you.
Tom really was horrible to you.
That's why I came to you.
I'd like to go home if it's all the same to you.
I know how important your problems are to you.
See if this makes sense to you.
I'm feeling really close to you.
I've never done anything to you.
Tom wasn't going to do anything to you.
Hey, lady, we're talking to you.
Tom, don't walk away when I'm talking to you.
Tell me why I'm talking to you.
I certainly don't mind Tom talking to you.
I guess that wouldn't mean much to you.
It'll come back to you.
Let me get back to you.
I'm going to get right back to you.
That's why I came to talk to you.
I can make the time to talk to you.
I won't let anything bad happen to you.
I'm very drawn to you.
I guess that'll be up to you.
I'll make this up to you.
I promise I'll make it up to you.
I'll do anything to make it up to you.
This will never happen again, I swear to you.
I guess this still belongs to you.
I know how this looks to you.
I want you to think about what really matters to you.
I just showed it to you.
Give me a chance to prove it to you.
I'll have it sent to you.
Maybe I'll run into you.
I was totally into you.
It's going to help you.
That isn't going to help you.
I don't know why I bother trying to help you.
I've instructed Tom to help you.
I must help you.
I think everybody's only pretending they don't hear you.
Let me tell you what I can offer you.
I don't wish to anger you.
It's not every day you get a building named after you.
They even named their boy after you.
I had a meal prepared for you.
I got it started for you.
That can't be good for you.
I guess that's good for you.
That shouldn't be hard for you.
There was a place for you.
That's gratitude for you.
Let me make this simple for you.
That's why I came for you.
Come by later, I have something for you.
Perhaps we'll ask Tom to suggest something for you.
Tom sacrificed everything for you.
If anything happens to Tom, I'll come looking for you.
There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
I'll have lunch waiting for you.
They'll be rooting for you.
Now, you let me know if this gets to be too much for you.
That should be enough for you.
I can make a phone call for you.
Tom, there's a telephone call for you.
That's why I fell for you.
I'm the only one who can get them for you.
Just think what it could do for you.
I'll have Tom bring up some dinner for you.
That'd be a good color for you.
I've got real feelings for you.
I grabbed this for you.
I can look into this for you.
I've been waiting in my quarters for you.
That's why I sent for you.
They're just for you.
Tom is just looking out for you.
I'm sure something will work out for you.
I don't think I have to spell it out for you.
I had dinner ready for you.
I'll make this easy for you.
I could tutor you.
You're not fooling anyone, Tom, we know it's you.
We all can't be as strong as you.
I don't know if you know this, but I'm not as smart as you.
I could see it was you.
I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
I know the cure for what ails you.
I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
I don't know how to address you.
You're not prepared for what awaits you.
I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
I'm surprised at you.
You said you needed someone to protect you.
It's a real pleasure to meet you.
It's a real honor to meet you.
It's a great honor to meet you.
It's so good to finally meet you.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
They're out to get you.
Sometimes I don't get you.
I've upset you.
I never should've left you.
Hey, Tom, glad I caught you.
That's why Tom hit you.
You'll never know what hit you.
I got you all right where I want you.
That's why we want you.
I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
I never would've shot you.
I almost shot you.
Come any closer, and I'll shoot you.
I figured it was better not to interrupt you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I hurt you.
I don't want to do anything that would hurt you.
We aren't here to hurt you.
I have no desire to hurt you.
It can't hurt you.
Don't think I won't hurt you.
I'm not going to hold that against you.
I don't hold that against you.
I won't hold it against you.
It'll cost you.
It's going to cost you.
That's why I trust you.
If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
I was never worried about you.
I should've listened to Tom when he warned me about you.
I never stop thinking about you.
I'm starting to get a bad feeling about you.
I'm not writing about you.
I've read all about you.
Not everything is about you.
Tom, this isn't about you.
I feel the same way about you.
Tom feels the same way about you.
That's why I worry about you.
I couldn't have solved this case without you.
We're better off without you.
I figured it was better not to go without you.
I can do this with you or without you.
I don't know if I can make it without you.
I wanted you the moment I saw you.
I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
Hey, Tom, you've gotten a lot taller since I last saw you.
I have so much to show you.
They just want to get to know you.
I don't need to be lectured by you.
I'm still intimidated by you.
We aren't here to destroy you.
I have to say I envy you.
You nearly broke my jaw.
It's against the law.
That's not what I saw.
Tom was surprised by something he saw.
Tom liked what he saw.
Tom seems to have a different point to view.
I told you everything I knew.
My condolences to you and your crew.
Tom bowed and withdrew.
Tom propped himself up on his elbow.
You and I both know you were the one who broke the window.
Tom crossed to the window.
Tom went and shut the window.
I'm going to find out who broke this window.
I'll make myself useful somehow.
You're missing the late show.
You should have your own talk show.
You were a no show.
Tom's irritation is starting to show.
I'm surprised Tom didn't show.
It's our only show.
Please tell me you're not buying this dog and pony show.
Keep your head low.
Tom is an eccentric fellow.
It's excruciatingly slow.
Leave this area now.
We're as good as dead now.
Tom is confined to bed now.
That's all changed now.

If you're ever going to help us with this, it has to be now.
It's got to be now.
Tom is at peace now.
We're on the same page now.
We're totally different people now.
You'll come with me now.
We have a bit of time now.
My computer works fine now.
I want guards posted here and I want them here now.
I get the picture now.
You're part of the gang now.
The air conditioner seems to be working now.
It seems to be working now.
They're bringing him in for questioning now.
I think everybody should stand back now.
I'm in the mood to talk now.
That's how I feel now.
I don't need to see Tom now.
We have to spend time with Tom now.
That doesn't mean you should tell Tom now.
You should get your money from Tom now.
I'm going to make my own decisions from now.
I'm going to advise you to just listen now.
I'm seeking a solution even now.
I need your full attention now.
Tom has got my full attention now.
You have to leave Boston now.
Tom isn't about to back down now.
Unless you have any more questions, I'd like to go now.
I'm going to hang up now.
We're all in this together now.
I'm hanging in there for now.
We'll go with that for now.
Tom seems to understand where he stands now.
I've failed Tom so many times now.
I need to end this now.
I insist that we do this now.
Let's do this now.
It would be prudent to worry about the details now.
I'd like to get Tom behind bars now.
I don't see that it matters now.
Tom has been in there for almost three hours now.
The machine's yours now.
I'm opening my presents now.
Tom is calling the shots now.
I can see that now.
I really don't recommend doing that now.
I'm not saying I want to do that now.
It's a bit late for that now.
Tom is just trying to get your goat now.
I think this is beside the point, right now.
We're in a dangerous area right now.
I can't be bothered right now.
I'm not saying you have to explain it all to me right now.
I've been where you are right now.
I just don't care right now.
I'm coming up there right now.
I'm on my way to the meeting right now.
We have a few pressing issues to deal right now.
You don't want to be in Boston right now.
I've never needed a friend more than I do right now.
I'm in no mood to argue politics right now.
I don't feel like sorting clothes right now.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about this right now.
I can't be distracted by this right now.
Tom is the least of my problems right now.
We're actually researching that right now.
I really can't comment on that right now.
I'm in no mood to do that right now.
I need to see a copy of it right now.
I don't think I could explain it right now.
That's what Tom's trying to figure out right now.
This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about right now.
That's all I know right now.
Tom is meeting with Mary right now.
Tom is going into surgery right now.
Tom is alright now.
We're in for it now.
We're serious about it now.
I'm practically an adult now.
It's so different now.
Nobody can keep us apart now.
I'm practically an expert now.
I'm very unhappy just now.
I think we've got it worked out now.
I think we've got it figured out now.
It's all behind you now.
No one's going to save you now.
I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I could kill you now.
I'm coming to you now.
I think that's up to you now.
If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
I meant to have that done by now.
According to his schedule, Tom should've been here by now.
I thought that was obvious by now.
You must realize that by now.
Tom knows better than that by now.
Tom should've been in contact by now.
Tom is a little creepy now.
Tom is one of the most decent men I know.
I don't know what I know.
I don't know how I know.
There's something I feel you should know.
We'll soon learn all we need to know.
I already know what I wanted to know.
I was ready to tell Tom anything he wanted to know.
You'd be the one to know.
It's not like Tom is going to know.
They know things these people want to know.
Now tell us what we want to know.
Trust me, you don't want to know.
I can ask Tom if you really want to know.
That's why I wanted you to know.
I guess we'll never know.
Tell me something interesting about Tom that I don't know.
I could get you fired, you know.
You don't fool me, you know.
We've got a situation here, you know.
Tom is out of control, you know.
I could really make things hard for you, you know.
I could really mess things up for you, you know.
You're wiser than you know.
Well, tell me what you know.
Let's go over what we already know.
I don't rightly know.
The path was narrow.
Tom said he'll pick you up from practice tomorrow.
Tom is sure to come tomorrow.
We won't get to you until tomorrow.
Tom is having his operation tomorrow.
We'll begin rehearsals tomorrow.
I'll be on my feet tomorrow.
I'm going to use it tomorrow.
I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
You should be out of here by tomorrow.
We're in the same fix.
I could swear there's something inside this box.
You haven't aged a day.
Tom smokes three packs a day.
Somebody's having a good day.
I'm having kind of a weird day.
I've had a really weird day.
Tom is packing up for the day.
It was bound to happen some day.
Tom felt deep inside that Mary was still alive, and he didn't give up hope to find and rescue her.
We'll get out of here one day.
Tom might want this back one day.
I've broken enough rules for one day.
We were destined to meet one day.
Tom had a real rough day.
It's your special day.
Today's your special day.
This is your special day.
I've been feeling this way all day.
You looked terrible the other day.
Tom put me on report the other day.
It's a gorgeous day.
It's a great day.
I'm kind of looking forward to a quiet day.
We had a slow day.
It's been a slow day.
Today must be your lucky day.
It's your lucky day.
Today's your lucky day.
Well, Tom, today is your lucky day.
Now, there's something you don't see every day.
We gain more knowledge every day.
I change my underwear every day.
Tom's heart's getting stronger every day.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.
We had a very busy day.
You'll thank me for this someday.
Tom wanted to skydive on his 30th birthday.
Tom couldn't seem to find anything suitable to give Mary for her birthday.
I have something very special planned for your birthday.
There's no way I'm going to work on Sunday.
Wait'll you hear what happened today.
Tom's trial started today.
You can't be around today.
You're in quite a mood today.
Hey, you're in a good mood today.
You're in a strange mood today.
You seem to be in such a nasty mood today.
Tom is acting very strange today.
Tom is going to die today.
I don't have any money on me today.
I'm having a very difficult time today.
I know you're not yourself today.
You've taken a big step today.
I heard you really screwed up today.
We're expecting lousy weather today.
That's plenty for today.
I know I've said some pretty stupid things today.
Tom made the company what it is today.
We have a new student joining our class today.
Tom is in high spirits today.
I really don't recommend that today.
I meant to cancel your appointment today.
I feel different today.
I feel funny today.
The most amazing thing happened yesterday.
I'm quite certain Tom was here yesterday.
Tom was in perfect health yesterday.
Tom showed me his garden yesterday.
You were such a big help yesterday.
We'll make our announcement on Thursday.
I'm going to hit the hay.
The organ started to play.
We have the whole summer to play.
This is child's play.
We offered Tom a month's severance pay.
There's a small price to pay.
That's an awfully high price to ask someone to pay.
That's the price you pay.
Maybe we should pray.
Tom began to pray.
It's just pepper spray.
You'll do exactly as I say.
That's what you should say.
Tom said you have the final say.
There's nothing more Tom can say.
Tom hasn't said anything he wasn't supposed to say.
I'll say what I have to say.
Tom was trying to think of the right thing to say.
Tom never listens to what I'm trying to say.
That's what I'm trying to say.
I have so much to say.
My real dad wouldn't tell me what to say.
That's kind of you to say.
That's nice of you to say.
That's easy enough for you to say.
That isn't for you to say.
Tom said that you said something I know you would never say.
I don't care what the regulations say.
That's exactly the kind of thing I don't want to hear you say.
It's as you say.
You know what they say.
It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
That doesn't mean I can stay.
We'll get you a place to stay.
It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
Tom didn't care to stay.
Let's just say I'm here to stay.
I can't possibly stay.
I'll be with you every step of the way.
Something tells me we're in the way.
It's on the way.
I've been feeling the same way.
You'd feel the same way.
We go back a long way.
You and Tom go back a long way.
I pay my own way.
I don't mind either way.
We've gone miles out of our way.
Tell me you're on your way.
That's the problem with doing things your way.
Tom was in Mary's way.
They're headed this way.
I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
Thanks for coming all this way.
I truly didn't know you felt this way.
I think they went this way.
It's on its way.
Pizza is on its way.
I don't know why I reacted that way.
Tom didn't deserve to die that way.
You can't talk to me that way.
You don't talk to me that way.
You'll never escape that way.
It doesn't look that way.
Hey, it doesn't work that way.
I told Tom that he was a fool to let Mary talk to him that way.
You've always been that way.
I don't think about you in that way.
It certainly looks that way.
I don't think it works that way.
I can't have you talking to the customers that way.
You can't talk to us that way.
I'm sure Tom didn't see it that way.
Please don't think of it that way.
I hadn't thought of it that way.
You can't get out that way.
I prefer that it stay that way.
Tom is kind of crazy that way.
I finally feel like everything's going my way.
I'm expected to overcome all obstacles in my way.
I'm glad they see it my way.
I had some cash stashed away.
I have some cash stashed away.
The laughter died away.
Tom hurried away.
Tom blushed and turned away.
They'll take me away.
You'll give me away.
I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
The bank is trying to take Tom's house away.
You'll give yourself away.
You've already given yourself away.
You never want to give anything away.
Tom doesn't want to give anything away.
We don't want to give too much away.
You take my breath away.
Just let me walk away.
I know it's hard to walk away.
Tom said I should just walk away.
I'm going to scare Tom away.
Tom was shot trying to run away.
It'll go away.
I just want my past to go away.
I can make this go away.
Tom wouldn't go away.
I said step away.
You seem a million miles away.
Tom's laughing could be heard three blocks away.
You both need to get away.
I just wanted to get away.
Tom had trouble sleeping when you went away.
You should be put away.
This will blow you away.
Tom helped me to clear snow away.
Tom just can't stay away.
Tom was trying to give his money away.
Tom made a clean getaway.
Get on the freeway.
They met each other halfway.
Tom didn't belong here anyway.
They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
Tom didn't pay me enough for that anyway.
Tom, I know this is an unfair question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.
Nice of you to drop by.
You just worry about taking care of your baby.
Seriously, Tom, you need a hobby.
I got to be pretty good at rugby.
Tom is afraid of intimacy.
Tom is a stickler for accuracy.
I've arranged for a bit of privacy.
Don't make me change that policy.
Tom has had a medical emergency.
You said there was an emergency.
Tom had a family emergency.
I'm at your mercy.
I can look at it when you're ready.
I have to get Tom's lunch ready.
Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
You're just in time. Tom is almost ready.
I can feel my pulse quickening already.
Come in already.
You have my attention already.
I'm practically an adult already.
Tom was saddened by the tragedy.
It'll come in handy.
I figured this might come in handy.
Keep your gun handy.
Tom doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
I'd like to do an autopsy on this body.
You could've killed somebody.
Tom has got nobody.
I never murdered anybody.
I've never actually tortured anybody.
It could be anybody.
Tom realized he wasn't convincing anybody.
It's all right, I won't tell anybody.
I know that better than anybody.
I didn't mean to usurp anybody.
That can't be good for anybody.
Tom didn't visit anybody.
Get up, everybody.
I think I've found enough for everybody.
They've taken Tom into protective custody.
We're going to try to get you full custody.
I'm releasing Tom into your custody.
I've been watching you study.
Let me get you the key.
Tom let himself in with his own key.
Tom let himself into the house with his key.
Tom began to carve the turkey.
I hope you bought us a big enough turkey.
Tom said this is up your alley.
I could sure use that reward money.
We're doing this for the money.
We're not doing this for the money.
We can make some money.
Tom made a bunch of money.
Tom says you won a whole bunch of money.
Green is the color of money.
Tom made his company lots of money.
I really don't have a lot of money.
I know it's a lot of money.
I never needed that much money.
I assure you this is about much more than money.
I want to see if I can find out where Tom hid the stolen money.
I could sure use that scholarship money.
I'm not asking for money.
We're not really asking for money.
Tom is always hitting me up for money.
You're not laying one finger on Tom's money.
You wanted to get your hands on Tom's money.
We make great money.
I could sure use that money.
Not everything's about money.
Not everything is about money.
I assure you this isn't just about money.
You gave me quite a run for my money.
You never have any money.
Tom is an excellent attorney.
I hope they have a pleasant journey.
I really appreciate your willingness to testify.
Tom is still pretty groggy.
This is no time to quibble over terminology.
It'll help you save energy.
They were wealthy.
Tom doesn't seem particularly trustworthy.
I want to know how this happened and why.
That still leaves us with the question of why.
We never learned what happened or why.
You said you figured out why.
I'll tell you why.
I couldn't tell you why.
Next time, you won't be so lucky.
I never thought I'd get that lucky.
I couldn't get that lucky.
Tom smiled affably.

Tom smiled halfheartedly.
Tom sighed profoundly.
Tom smiled awkwardly.
Tom smiled inwardly.
Tom applauded loudly.
I think this will do nicely.
I just want to get Tom home safely.
It seemed likely.
That would seem likely.
It seems likely.
I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
Tom looked at them closely.
Tom looked at Mary closely.
I want my money returned immediately.
I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately.
We'll get you back home immediately.
I insist that we leave immediately.
It's you who've acted inappropriately.
Tom is just a little stressed lately.
Tom has been a little unapproachable lately.
Tom has been awfully distant lately.
I'm hearing that a lot lately.

It's getting ugly.
It's going to get ugly.
This might get ugly.

This just got ugly.
You said you wanted a family.
Tom is an old acquaintance of the family.
Tom has something for the entire family.
I just thought that you might want to go home and be with your family.
You belong at home with your family.
Think about your family.
Tom is a disgrace to his family.
Tom is supported by his family.
I'm still part of this family.
I have to be there for my family.
I let my guard down momentarily.
Tom clenched his fists angrily.
Tom looked at Mary uneasily.
Tom smiled guiltily.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
Tom turned the page quickly.
I can get us there more quickly.
Tom needs to think of a solution quickly.
Tom got up quickly.
Tom closed his eyes quickly.

I need to get something done very quickly.
Tom stared at Mary blankly.
Tom was laughing hysterically.

Tom was put to death finally.
Don't take it so personally.
Don't take this personally.
It feels silly.
I suppose it was a bit silly.
The sail won't open fully.
Tom looks as if he's sleeping peacefully.
Tom slept peacefully.
I could have warned Tom more forcefully.
Tom smiled hopefully.
Tom prepared his speech very carefully.
Tom smiled gratefully.
Tom performed his duties faithfully.

I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
I came in early.

You'll enjoy it tremendously.
We've got to talk seriously.

You do like living dangerously.

It should be ready shortly.
Tom nodded curtly.
You look positively ghastly.
The door closed slowly.
Tom sipped his wine slowly.
Know your enemy.
Tom was drafted into the army.
That's as good a place as any.
This is as good place to die as any.
That's as good a way to die as any.
I suppose this is as good a time as any.
That's as good an explanation as any.
That's as good a reason as any.
There are so many.
I don't think I'd be very good company.
I suppose I could use the company.
Tom is the majority shareholder in the company.
Tom is joining our company.
You control your destiny.

Tom will never have to worry about going hungry.
Tom felt himself getting hungry.
Tom was suddenly very hungry.
That's quite a theory.
I hope you'll find this office satisfactory.
I thought Tom's performance was satisfactory.
It's a very small price for such an important victory.
This is dangerous territory.
Hey, it's just a story.
Tom patiently waited for Mary to finish her story.
They want to tell you their story.
I'm not buying your story.
Tom told us his story.
That's a different story.
I told Tom my story.
Tom isn't being entirely truthful about his job history.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
Tom will be so sorry.
I'm not buying you another drink until you say sorry.
If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
I just didn't want you to worry.
There wasn't any special hurry.
If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
You better hurry.
Someday you should give it a try.
We can make it if we try.
That's good for a first try.
My picture's in every police station in the country.
Tom seems to have left the country.
I'm considered a traitor to this country.
You're making this too easy.
Life could be so easy.
Thank you for making it so easy.
You're not making this easy.
Tom isn't getting off that easy.
I felt very uneasy.
It's a bit flimsy.
People are getting antsy.
I should've guessed you'd be busy.
People like you are never busy.
Like I said, I was busy.
I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
This is for your own safety.
We're concerned for your safety.
There's no reason for you to fear for your safety.
I was worried for Tom's safety.
You're personally responsible for Tom's safety.
Everyone is getting fidgety.

You're a big softy.
We're safer here than we would be in a city.
I heard Tom hates publicity.
You don't have to worry about publicity.
Tom does have one redeeming quality.
It's a huge responsibility.
I've never been able to handle responsibility.
Tom hadn't considered that possibility.
I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
Have a little dignity.
Tom has immunity.
Tom was a native of Boston with deep roots in the community.
It's a remarkable opportunity.
You had plenty of opportunity.
I'm giving you an opportunity.
I know it's a great opportunity.
Tom thinks I'm missing this great opportunity.
You may have that opportunity.
I regret losing that opportunity.
I have a problem dealing with authority.
I didn't mean to challenge your authority.
Tom is a psychology major at a major university.
I admire their ingenuity.
Tom is supposed to be guilty.
I think someone stole all these things and planted them to make me look guilty.

I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty.
The roads were empty.

Now we've got ourselves a party.
I'm at an office party.
I'll throw you a stag party.
I'll throw you a bachelor party.
You'll never make it to Tom's party.
Tom drove all the way from Boston just for my birthday party.
We have a warrant to search your property.
It makes me feel dirty.
That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.
You say you don't want to get your hands dirty.
Tom is still on the right side of thirty.
This is no time for modesty.
What's happened here is a travesty.
I'm so thirsty.
Tom can be a little chatty.
Did I tell you I think you're pretty?
You're so pretty.
I'm reporting for duty.
Tom reminded us of our duty.
I'm going to ask you to do your duty.
Tom only likes women under thirty or over sixty.

Please tell me it's crazy.
You're the one that went crazy.
It's normal for you to feel a bit woozy.
What's happening here at 2:30?
Where were you on 9/11?
Are you telling this story or am I?
I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
I'll be OK as long as I stay awake, won't I?
I just need you to trust me, OK?
I'm going to be right there, OK?
Tell Tom I'll just be a minute, OK?
I don't want you to worry about anything, OK?
Let me finish, OK?
If you need something, just ask Tom, OK?
It scared me, too, OK?
Don't scare me like that, OK?
Let's just drop the subject, OK?
Let's talk this thing out, OK?
You just have to relax, OK?
Why all the drama?
What does that have to do with the price of beans in China?
How do you feel about opera?
Are we getting pizza?
Who picked you for this job?
Which one of you is the psychic?
How could anyone not like music?
Aren't you the romantic?
Should I feel bad?
How long has Tom been dead?
Are you suggesting that Tom isn't dead?
How come you're not dead?
Why aren't you dead?
What would we do instead?
How many beers have you had?
How many have you had?
Did that make Tom mad?
Did that make you mad?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
How would you like us to proceed?
Is it time you need?
Is it money you need?
How do you think Tom died?
Is that why they died?
Would you happen to be married?
Were you there when Tom talked?
Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
What have I misspelled?

Why do you think Tom was killed?
How many men have you killed?
How many have you killed?
How could it have happened?
Whereabouts did you say this happened?
Can you determine what happened?
What's your theory on what happened?
Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
Do you want to tell the jury what happened?
Where was Tom imprisoned?
Are you suggesting Tom was murdered?
Where were you when the fire occurred?
How are you connected?
Don't you always do what's expected?
Were you even tempted?
Do you mind if I get started?

Where shall we begin?
Where do we even begin?
Does Tom really want to win?
Can you tell what deck we're on?
Hey, can we get a move on?
Don't you see what's going on?

So how did the date go?
How fast does this thing go?
How did Tom's hearing go?
How far would Tom go?
I may be stating the obvious, but there are many Canadians in Canada.

I'd suggest we don't go down that road.
Despite their efforts, they didn't succeed.
Even wounds that have healed, leave scars behind.

That's not an issue anymore.
Save your long-winded explanations for someone else.
Tom was as poor as a church mouse.
That never was an issue.
That's not an issue.
It depends on how much money you have.

You can't get rid of it.
Tom got away with it.
I want to make a statement.
We need to take this into account.
Tom got off with a slap on the wrist.
My patience is running out.
Tom stared dejectedly out the window.
Tom looked absently out the window.
Tom is a funny little fellow.
A clear conscience is the best pillow.
Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
It's just a stone's throw away.
Don't take it quite so literally.
Don't take it so literally.

Does that feel right?
Do I have it right?
Can you hold that thought?
Have you confirmed it?
Your name wouldn't be Tom, would it?
That wouldn't be Tom, would it?
This wouldn't be about Tom, would it?
How'd you find it?
Are you so stupid that you can't see it?
How did we not see it?

Can we just drop it?
Would you drop it?
Should we run for it?
Are you sure you're up for it?
That doesn't explain what happened, does it?
It really doesn't affect you, does it?
Life isn't fair, is it?
That's not one of Tom's, is it?
How accurate is it?
How special is it?
That sounds credible, doesn't it?
I guess that goes without saying, doesn't it?
That's why you're here, isn't it?
It's really not safe for you here, isn't it?
This is pretty tense, isn't it?
That's your answer for everything, isn't it?
I think that's up to Tom, isn't it?
This is kind of sudden, isn't it?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
That's the tricky part, isn't it?
That's the safest way, isn't it?
Where on earth did you get it?
Who could forget it?
Does that mean you bought it?
Did I blow it?
Didn't I tell you Tom would blow it?
How could you allow it?
What's with the outfit?
How is that significant?

Which way is out?
Why did Tom blow his brains out?
Do you have any children you haven't told me about?
When did this come about?
Who else are we talking about?
So what were we talking about?
So what are you talking about?
Do you know what this is all about?
Did Tom say what it was about?
Who do we see next?
Why does Tom need you?
Have they spotted you?
What do the rest of us have to do to convince you?
Did the phone wake you?
How do people like you get to be people like you?
How does that strike you?
You're not the police, are you?
You're not attracted to me, are you?
You're not a city girl, are you?
You're not one of them, are you?
You're not one of us, are you?
You're not really asking people to believe that, are you?
So how mad are you?
What kind of sick weirdo are you?
Just who are you?
Does Tom scare you?
How can I refuse you?
How could Tom hate you?
Why do I believe you?
What kind of shots did they give you?
Is that bothering you?
Don't you see that Tom's using you?
How much am I paying you?
Can I share something important with you?
What could Tom possibly want with you?
How do I thank you?
Am I supposed to thank you?
Did I ask you?
What do I call you?
What can I tell you?
Why do you think I didn't tell you?
Well, what does that tell you?
Get some help, will you?
Why should we harm you?
If anything happens here, can I depend on you?
You never stop, do you?
You never have any doubts, do you?
You don't have a lot to say, do you?
Do I look dead to you?
What would I do if something happened to you?
Can you tell us what happened to you?

Does that seem strange to you?
How could I lie to you?
Does Tom sound like a woman's name to you?
Why did Tom come to you?
Does the term self-preservation mean anything to you?
Does the name Tom Jackson mean anything to you?
What makes you think Tom was talking to you?
How do they seem to you?
What do I mean to you?
Do I look like a policeman to you?
Why do all the cool things happen to you?
Doesn't anything ever get to you?
Doesn't it sometimes just get to you?
Do I look happy to you?
Do I look busy to you?
What in the world got into you?
What's got into you?
When is good for you?
Was that weird for you?
Can I set a place at the table for you?
How's that going for you?
Isn't that enough for you?
Does Tom always speak for you?
Does that work for you?
What was in it for you?
What drives you?
Is there a particular way I'm supposed to address you?
You knew all along it was Tom, didn't you?
You're one of them, aren't you?
You're scared of being hurt, aren't you?
You were Tom's accomplice, weren't you?
I guess you think you're pretty special, don't you?
You probably agree with Tom, don't you?

You know what they can do, don't you?
What did Tom say when he met you?
How would you like it if I hit you?
Did Tom try to assault you?

Is it safe for us to look now?
Why wait until now?
Can you imagine what life will be like for them now?
Am I under investigation now?
Am I supposed to answer that question now?
Can we go home and go to sleep now?
Do you have any idea how stupid I feel right now?

I don't deny I made a mistake.
I must've made a mistake.
Tom must've made a mistake.
You must've made a mistake.

It's an understandable mistake.
I think you've just made a big mistake.
That's a very common mistake.
Tom apologized for his mistake.
When you called, I was already awake.
Maybe I'll buy a bike.
That's what I like.

I forget where I put my hat.
I shouldn't have downloaded that.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
We've already settled that.
Tom admitted that.
Please forget I said that.
I didn't say I did that.

I never asked you to do that.
I never advised you to do that.
I didn't tell you to do that.
There's really no need for you to do that.
Tom might be able to tell us how to do that.
I want to show you how to do that.
I know how to do that.
I think I know how to do that.
Tom is supposed to know how to do that.
I already said I don't know how to do that.

It's too soon for that.
I don't think Tom knows that.
Everyone says that.
I don't think you should eat that.
Please don't make me eat that.
Please don't force me to eat that.
I can't forget that.
I'll not forget that.

I thought you wouldn't want that.
There's no mistake about that.
Nothing could be done about that.
I remember something about that.
Tom never said anything about that.

Tom is wrong about that.
I think you might need to talk to Tom about that.
I want you to talk to Tom about that.
There's no doubt about that.
Tom was right about that.
Perhaps Tom was right about that.
Tom wasn't right about that.
Let me show you where to put that.
I didn't intend to tell you that.
Everybody knew that.
Don't let Tom know that.
Tom might be able to fix that.
I know how to fix that.
They all say that.
I had a feeling Tom was going to say that.
Tom ought to have known better than to say that.
I'm still not sure what you mean by that.

I won't deny that.
I knew you'd enjoy that.

In winter, the windows were sometimes quite frozen over. But then the boy and the girl would warm copper pennies on the stove, and hold the warm pennies against the frozen pane; there would be very soon a little round hole through which they could peep, and the soft bright eyes of the little boy and girl would beam through the hole at each window as they looked at each other.
That was my only comfort.
That was our only consolation.
That was my only consolation.
He was a good friend of mine.

"See there are the white bees swarming," said Kay's old grandmother one day when it was snowing.
Sometimes on a winter's night the Snow Queen flies through the streets of the town, and breathes with her frosty breath upon the windows, and then they are covered with strange and beautiful forms, like trees and flowers.
Often at midnight the Snow Queen flies through the streets of the town, and looks in at the windows, then the ice freezes on the panes into wonderful shapes, that look like flowers and castles.
"Can the Snow Queen come in here?" asked the little girl.
Then the grandmother smoothed his hair and told him some more tales.
And the grandmother stroked his hair and told him some stories.
A few flakes of snow were falling, and one of them, rather larger than the rest, alighted on the edge of one of the flower boxes.
The snow-flake appeared larger and larger, and at last took the form of a lady dressed in the finest white crape, her attire being composed of millions of star-like particles. She was exquisitely fair and delicate, but entirely of ice, glittering, dazzling ice; her eyes gleamed like two bright stars.
This snow-flake grew larger and larger, till at last it became the figure of a woman, dressed in garments of white gauze, which looked like millions of starry snow-flakes linked together. She was fair and beautiful, but made of ice- shining and glittering ice. Still she was alive and her eyes sparkled like bright stars, but there was neither peace nor rest in their glance.
The little boy was frightened and jumped down from the chair.
The little boy was frightened and sprang from the chair.
On the following day there was a clear frost, and very soon came the spring. The sun shone; the young green leaves burst forth; the swallows built their nests; windows were opened, and the children sat once more in the garden on the roof, high above all the other rooms.
How beautiful the roses blossomed this summer.
The little girl had learnt a hymn in which roses were spoken of, and then she thought of their own roses, and she sang the hymn to the little boy, and he sang too.
They held each other by the hand, kissed the roses, and looked up into the blue sky, talking away all the time.
What glorious summer days were those! how delightful it was to sit under those rose-trees which seemed as if they never intended to stop blossoming!
One day, Kay and Gerda sat looking at a book full of pictures of animals and birds.
Mom, I don't want to go!
The little girl put her arm around his neck, and looked into his eye, but she could see nothing.
"I think it is gone," he said. But it was not gone.
Could you take a picture of me?
"Kay, what are you doing?" cried the little girl.
He began to mimic the speech and gait of persons in the street.
One winter's day, when it snowed, he brought out a burning-glass, then he held out the tail of his blue coat, and let the snow-flakes fall upon it. "Look in this glass, Gerda," said he; and she saw how every flake of snow was magnified, and looked like a beautiful flower or a glittering star.
Soon after this Kay came in again, with thick gloves on his hands, and his sledge slung across his back.
The boldest boys in the square used to fasten their sledges firmly to the wagons of the country people, and thus drive a good way along with them.
In the great square, the boldest among the boys would often tie their sledges to the country people's carts, and go with them a good way.
While they were all amusing themselves, a great sledge came by; it was painted white, and in it sat some one wrapped in a rough white fur, and wearing a white cap.
The snow began to fall so heavily that the little boy could not see a hand's breadth before him.
The snow began to fall so thickly that the little boy could not see his own hand.
He called out loudly, but nobody heard him.
Then he cried out as loud as he could, but no one heard him.
The boy was frightened, and tried to say a prayer, but he could remember nothing but the multiplication table.
The snow-flakes became larger and larger, till they appeared like great white chickens.
The snow-flakes seemed larger and larger, at last they looked like great white fowls.
The fur and the cap, which were made entirely of snow, fell off, and he saw a lady, tall and white, it was the Snow Queen.
"We have driven well," said she, "but why do you tremble? here, creep into my warm fur." Then she seated him beside her in the sledge, and as she wrapped the fur around him.
'We have driven fast!' said she, 'but no one likes to be frozen; creep under my bear-skin,' and she seated him in the sledge by her side, and spread her cloak around him.
"Are you still cold," she asked, as she kissed him on the forehead.
Oh! her kiss was colder than ice.
The Snow Queen kissed Kay again, and he entirely forgot little Gerda, her grandmother, and all at home.
"Now you must have no more kisses," she said.
In his eyes, she was perfect.
They flew over woods and lakes, over sea and land; below them roared the wild wind; the wolves howled and the snow crackled; over them flew the black screaming crows, and above all shone the moon, clear and bright.
The storm blew and howled as if it were singing old songs.
Many tears were shed for him, and little Gerda wept bitterly for a long time.
'Now you must have no more kisses!' said she, 'else I should kiss thee to death.'
Oh, indeed those long winter days were very dreary. But at last spring came, with warm sunshine.
At last came the spring, with its warm sunshine.
"He is dead and gone," she said to the sparrows. "We don't believe it," they replied.
I will give you my red shoes if you will give him back to me.
It seemed as if the waves nodded to her in a strange manner.
Then she took off her red shoes, which she liked better than anything else, and threw them both into the river.
Then little Gerda was very much frightened, and began to cry, but no one heard her except the sparrows.
The banks on each side of the river were very pretty. There were beautiful flowers, old trees, sloping fields, in which cows and sheep were grazing, but not a man to be seen.
She was rather afraid of the strange old woman.
Gerda was glad to be on dry land again, although she was a little afraid of the strange old lady.
"Come and tell me who you are," said she, "and how came you here."
Then Gerda told her everything, while the old woman shook her head, and said, "Hem-hem."
She slept in an elegant bed with red silk pillows, embroidered with colored violets; and then she dreamed as pleasantly as a queen on her wedding day.
The next day, and for many days after, Gerda played with the flowers in the warm sunshine.
Can the fire of the heart be extinguished in the flames of the funeral pile?
"I don't understand that at all," said little Gerda.
Near yonder narrow road stands an old knight's castle; thick ivy creeps over the old ruined walls, leaf over leaf, even to the balcony, in which stands a beautiful maiden. She bends over the balustrades, and looks up the road. No rose on its stem is fresher than she; no apple-blossom, wafted by the wind, floats more lightly than she moves. Her rich silk rustles as she bends over and exclaims, 'Will he not come?'
Between two trees a rope is hanging; there is a piece of board upon it; it is a swing. Two pretty little girls, in dresses white as snow, and with long green ribbons fluttering from their hats, are sitting upon it swinging.
There were three beautiful sisters, fair and delicate. The dress of one was red, of the second blue, and of the third pure white. Hand in hand they danced in the bright moonlight, by the calm lake.
Do the dancing maidens sleep, or are they dead? The scent of the flower says that they are corpses. The evening bell tolls their knell.
The bright warm sun shone on a little court, on the first warm day of spring. His bright beams rested on the white walls of the neighboring house; and close by bloomed the first yellow flower of the season, glittering like gold in the sun's warm ray.
"I can see myself, I can see myself," said the narcissus. "Oh, how sweet is my perfume!"
Oh, how dark and weary the whole world appeared!
Gerda was obliged to rest again, and just opposite the place where she sat, she saw a great crow come hopping across the snow toward her.
She kissed the crow, and hugged him almost to death with joy.
"Does he live with a princess?" asked Gerda.
I was disappointed because you weren't at home.
The coach was well stored with sweet cakes, and under the seat were fruit and gingerbread nuts.
At the door, she found a coach made of pure gold, with the coat-of-arms of the prince and princess shining upon it like a star.
Soup was boiling in a large cauldron.
"Where was the Snow Queen going? Do you know anything about it?" "She was most likely travelling to Lapland, where there is always snow and ice."
"Do you know where Lapland is?" she asked the reindeer.

"Did you like the movie?" -- "Yes, a lot!"

I lost everything I had so painstakingly collected over the years.
It was so terribly hot inside that that woman wore scarcely any clothes.
The woman loosened little Gerda's dress, and took off the fur boots and the mittens, or Gerda would have been unable to bear the heat; and then she placed a piece of ice on the reindeer's head.
Can't you give this little maiden something which will make her as strong as twelve men, to overcome the Snow Queen?
This is of interest to me.
"Can't you give this little maiden something which will make her as strong as twelve men, to overcome the Snow Queen?" "The Power of twelve men!" said the Finnish woman; "that would be of very little use."
Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen, but he finds everything there so much to his taste and his liking, that he believes it is the finest place in the world; but this is because he has a piece of broken glass in his heart, and a little piece of glass in his eye. These must be taken out, or he will never be a human being again, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.
"I can give her no greater power than she has already," said the woman; "don't you see how strong that is?"
She cannot receive any power from me greater than she now has, which consists in her own purity and innocence of heart.
Could you take my picture?
The cold was so great that she could see her own breath come out of her mouth like steam.
The walls of the palace were formed of drifted snow, and the windows and doors of the cutting winds.
Empty, vast, and cold were the halls of the Snow Queen.
The flickering flame of the northern lights could be plainly seen, whether they rose high or low in the heavens, from every part of the castle.
In the midst of its empty, endless hall of snow was a frozen lake, broken on its surface into a thousand forms; each piece resembled another, from being in itself perfect as a work of art, and in the centre of this lake sat the Snow Queen, when she was at home.
Just at this moment it happened that little Gerda came through the great door of the castle.
She threw her arms round his neck, and held him fast, while she exclaimed, "Kay, dear little Kay, I have found you at last."
Then little Gerda wept hot tears, which fell on his breast, and penetrated into his heart, and thawed the lump of ice, and washed away the little piece of glass which had stuck there.
Gerda, dear little Gerda, where have you been all this time, and where have I been?
Then Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they became blooming; and she kissed his eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and his feet, and then he became quite healthy and cheerful.
Then they took each other by the hand, and went forth from the great palace of ice.
When they arrived at the bush with red berries, there stood the reindeer waiting for them, and he had brought another young reindeer with him.
Both the reindeer ran by their side, and followed them as far as the boundaries of the country, where the first green leaves were budding.
Then the birds began to twitter, and the forest too was full of green young leaves; and out of it came a beautiful horse.
A young girl was riding upon the horse, with a shining red cap on her head, and pistols in her belt.
"And the crow?" asked Gerda. "Oh, the crow is dead," she replied.
Stop crying!
They went upstairs into the little room, where all looked just as it used to do. The old clock was going "tick, tick," and the hands pointed to the time of day, but as they passed through the door into the room they perceived that they were both grown up, and become a man and woman.
The roses out on the roof were in full bloom, and peeped in at the window; and there stood the little chairs, on which they had sat when children; and Kay and Gerda seated themselves each on their own chair, and held each other by the hand, while the cold empty grandeur of the Snow Queen's palace vanished from their memories like a painful dream.
It was beautiful in the country, it was summer-time; the wheat was yellow, the oats were green, the hay was stacked up in the green meadow.
In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors.
"What are you doing here?" "I was just passing by."

At length one shell cracked, and then another, and from each egg came a living creature that lifted its head and cried, "Peep, peep."

The pledge to stop smoking cigarettes ranks among the top ten New Year's resolutions year after year.
"One egg is not hatched yet," said the duck.
At last the large egg broke, and a young one crept forth crying, "Peep, peep." It was very large and ugly. The duck stared at it and exclaimed, "It is very large and not at all like the others."
One of these eggs hasn't hatched yet.
On the next day the weather was delightful, and the sun shone brightly on the green burdock leaves, so the mother duck took her young brood down to the water, and jumped in with a splash.

But the poor duckling, who had crept out of his shell last of all, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and made fun of, not only by the ducks, but by all the poultry.
The poor duckling did not know where to go, and was quite miserable because he was so ugly and laughed at by the whole farmyard.
The poor duckling was driven about by every one; even his brothers and sisters were unkind to him, and would say, "Ah, you ugly creature, I wish the cat would get you," and his mother said she wished he had never been born.
The ducks pecked him, the chickens beat him, and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him with her feet.
"They are afraid of me because I am ugly," he said.
"What sort of a duck are you?" they all said, coming round him. He bowed to them, and was as polite as he could be, but he did not reply to their question. "You are exceedingly ugly," said the wild ducks, "but that will not matter if you do not want to marry one of our family."
"Pop, pop," sounded in the air, and the two wild geese fell dead among the rushes, and the water was tinged with blood.
The blue smoke from the guns rose like clouds over the dark trees.
"Oh," sighed the duckling, "how thankful I am for being so ugly; even a dog will not bite me."
The hen had very short legs, so she was called "Chickie short legs." She laid good eggs, and her mistress loved her as if she had been her own child.
The tom cat was the master of the house, and the hen was mistress, and they always said, "We and the world," for they believed themselves to be half the world, and the better half too. The duckling thought that others might hold a different opinion on the subject, but the hen would not listen to such doubts.
So the duckling left the cottage, and soon found water on which it could swim and dive, but was avoided by all other animals, because of its ugly appearance.
Autumn came, and the leaves in the forest turned to orange and gold. Then, as winter approached, the wind caught them as they fell and whirled them in the cold air.
The clouds, heavy with hail and snow-flakes, hung low in the sky, and the raven stood on the ferns crying, "Croak, croak." It made one shiver with cold to look at him.
All this was very sad for the poor little duckling.
One evening, just as the sun set amid radiant clouds, there came a large flock of beautiful birds out of the bushes.
The winter grew colder and colder; he was obliged to swim about on the water to keep it from freezing, but every night the space on which he swam became smaller and smaller. At length it froze so hard that the ice in the water crackled as he moved, and the duckling had to paddle with his legs as well as he could, to keep the space from closing up. He became exhausted at last, and lay still and helpless, frozen fast in the ice.
Early in the morning, a peasant, who was passing by, saw what had happened. He broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe, and carried the duckling home to his wife. The warmth revived the poor little creature.
The children laughed and screamed, and tumbled over each other, in their efforts to catch him; but luckily he escaped.
It would be very sad, were I to relate all the misery and privations which the poor little duckling endured during the hard winter.
He felt the warm sun shining, and heard the lark singing, and saw that all around was beautiful spring.
Then the young bird felt that his wings were strong, as he flapped them against his sides, and rose high into the air.
The apple-trees were in full blossom, and the fragrant elders bent their long green branches down to the stream which wound round a smooth lawn.
Everything looked beautiful, in the freshness of early spring.
From a thicket close by came three beautiful white swans, rustling their feathers, and swimming lightly over the smooth water.
But what did he see in the clear stream below? His own image; no longer a dark, gray bird, ugly and disagreeable to look at, but a graceful and beautiful swan.
He now felt glad at having suffered sorrow and trouble, because it enabled him to enjoy so much better all the pleasure and happiness around him.
The great swans swam round the new-comer, and stroked his neck with their beaks, as a welcome.
The new one is the most beautiful of all; he is so young and pretty.
Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wing; for he did not know what to do.
He had been persecuted and despised for his ugliness, and now he heard them say he was the most beautiful of all the birds.
Then he rustled his feathers, curved his slender neck, and cried joyfully, from the depths of his heart, "I never dreamed of such happiness as this, while I was an ugly duckling."
In a certain Tsardom, across three times nine kingdoms, beyond high mountain chains, there once lived a merchant. He had been married for twelve years, but in that time there had been born to him only one child, a daughter, who from her cradle was called Vasilissa the Beautiful.
When the little girl was eight years old the mother fell ill, and before many days it was plain to be seen that she must die.
My little Vasilissa, my dear daughter, listen to what I say, remember well my last words and fail not to carry out my wishes. I am dying, and with my blessing, I leave to thee this little doll. It is very precious for there is no other like it in the whole world. Carry it always about with thee in thy pocket and never show it to anyone. When evil threatens thee or sorrow befalls thee, go into a corner, take it from thy pocket and give it something to eat and drink. It will eat and drink a little, and then thou mayest tell it thy trouble and ask its advice, and it will tell thee how to act in thy time of need.
She kissed her little daughter on the forehead, blessed her, and shortly after died.
Little Vasilissa grieved greatly for her mother, and her sorrow was so deep that when the dark night came, she lay in her bed and wept and did not sleep.
Then the doll's eyes began to shine like fireflies, and suddenly it became alive.
Don't weep, little Vasilissa. Grief is worst at night. Lie down, shut thine eyes, comfort thyself and go to sleep. The morning is wiser than the evening.
Now after the death of his wife, the merchant grieved for many days as was right, but at the end of that time he began to desire to marry again and to look about him for a suitable wife.
Of all the women he saw, however, the one who, to his mind, suited him best of all, was a widow of about his own age with two daughters of her own, and she, he thought, besides being a good housekeeper, would be a kind foster mother to his little Vasilissa.
So the merchant married the widow and brought her home as his wife, but the little girl soon found that her foster mother was very far from being what her father had thought. She was a cold, cruel woman, who had desired the merchant for the sake of his wealth, and had no love for his daughter.
Vasilissa was the greatest beauty in the whole village.
Because Vasilissa was the greatest beauty in the whole village, her stepmother and her two daughters envied and hated her.
They treated her so cruelly as to leave few joys in life for her.
She grew every day more and more beautiful.
There, my little doll, take it. Eat a little, drink a little, and listen to my grief. I live in my father's house, but my spiteful stepmother wishes to drive me out of the white world. Tell me! How shall I act, and what shall I do?
Then the little doll's eyes would begin to shine like glowworms, and it would become alive.
Years passed, till Vasilissa grew up and became of an age when it is good to marry. All the young men in the village, high and low, rich and poor, asked for her hand, while not one of them stopped even to look at the stepmother's two daughters, so ill-favored were they.
Another coffee, please.
He started to get hungry, so he threw a small stone in the river to kill a fish.
We are all in terrible danger.
Each time, when she had let a suitor out of the door, she would soothe her anger and hatred by beating her stepdaughter.
She started to get hungry, so she threw a small stone in the river to kill a fish.
So while Vasilissa grew each day more lovely and graceful, she was often miserable, and but for the little doll in her pocket, would have longed to leave the white world.
Now there came a time when it became necessary for the merchant to leave his home and to travel to a distant Tsardom. He bade farewell to his wife and her two daughters, kissed Vasilissa and gave her his blessing and departed, bidding them say a prayer each day for his safe return.
Every day, while her two daughters were working indoors, the merchant's wife would send Vasilissa on one errand or other into the forest, either to find a branch of a certain rare bush or to bring her flowers or berries.
Deep in this forest, as the stepmother well knew, there was a green lawn and on the lawn stood a miserable little hut on hens' legs, where lived a certain Baba Yaga, an old witch grandmother.
Who came up with something like that?
Have you laughed yet today?
And what did she answer?
And what was her answer?
At first I didn't understand what it said.
At first I didn't understand what he was saying.
The merchant's wife sent Vasilissa into the forest each day, hoping she might meet the old witch and be devoured.

"We must go and fetch fire," said the first. "The only house near is a hut in the forest, where a Baba Yaga lives. One of us must go and borrow fire from her."
They both rose up, pushed Vasilissa out of the house and locked the door, crying: "Thou shalt not come in till thou hast fetched the fire."
There, my little doll, take it. Eat a little and listen to my sorrow. I must go to the hut of the old Baba Yaga in the dark forest to borrow some fire and I fear she will eat me. Tell me! What shall I do?
Then the doll's eyes began to shine like two stars and it became alive.
Do not fear, little Vasilissa. Go where thou hast been sent. While I am with thee no harm shall come to thee from the old witch.
Vasilissa put the doll back into her pocket, crossed herself and started out into the dark, wild forest.
The wood was very dark, and she could not help trembling from fear.
The wall around the hut was made of human bones and on its top were skulls.
The sight filled Vasilissa with horror and she stopped as still as a post buried in the ground.
When she woke next morning, very early, it was still dark.
Why was the Egyptian boy confused? His daddy was really a mummy.

"My dearest little doll!" she cried. "Thou hast saved me from my trouble! Now I have only to cook the Baba Yaga's supper, since all the rest of the tasks are done!"
There was not a weed left in the yard, nor a speck of dust on the floors, nor a single black grain or wild pea in the wheat.
The old witch was greatly angered, but was obliged to pretend to be pleased. "Well," she said, "thou hast done all well."
Well, why dost thou say nothing, but stand there as if thou wast dumb?
"If thou wilt allow me, grandmother, I wish to ask thee some questions." "Well," said the old witch, "only remember that every question does not lead to good. If thou knowest overmuch, thou wilt grow old too soon. What wilt thou ask?"
The Baba Yaga seized from the wall one of the skulls with burning eyes and flung it after her. "There," she howled, "is the fire for thy stepmother's daughters. Take it. That is what they sent thee here for, and may they have joy of it!"
Vasilissa put the skull on the end of a stick and darted away through the forest, running as fast as she could, finding her path by the skull's glowing eyes which went out only when morning came.
Since Vasilissa had gone, the stepmother and her two daughters had had neither fire nor light in all the house.
The eyes of the skull suddenly began to glimmer and to glow like red coals, and wherever the three turned or ran the eyes followed them, growing larger and brighter till they flamed like two furnaces, and hotter and hotter till the merchant's wife and her two wicked daughters took fire and were burned to ashes. Only Vasilissa the Beautiful was not touched.
But their troubles weren't over yet.
In the morning, Vasilissa dug a deep hole in the ground and buried the skull.

When the Tsar saw the linen he was struck with astonishment at its fineness and beauty.
Vasilissa washed her face, dressed her hair, put on her best gown and sat down at the window to see what would happen.
Vasilissa rose and went at once to the Palace, and as soon as the Tsar saw her, he fell in love with her with all his soul.
"Beautiful maiden," he said, "never will I part from thee and thou shalt be my wife."
So the Tsar and Vasilissa the Beautiful were married, and her father returned from the far-distant Tsardom, and he and the old woman lived always with her in the splendid Palace, in all joy and contentment. And as for the little wooden doll, she carried it about with her in her pocket all her life long.
Because Vasilissa was the greatest beauty in the whole village, the stepmother and her two daughters envied and hated her.
In Russia, as elsewhere in the world, folklore is rapidly scattering before the practical spirit of modern progress. The traveling peasant bard or story teller, and the devoted "nyanya", the beloved nurse of many a generation, are rapidly dying out, and with them the tales and legends, the last echoes of the nation's early joys and sufferings, hopes and fears, are passing away.
In sending forth the stories in the present volume, all of which are here set down in print for the first time, it is my hope that they may enable American children to share with the children of Russia the pleasure of glancing into the magic world of the old Slavic nation.
They had three sons, all of them young, and such brave fellows that no pen could describe them.
One day their father said to his sons: "My dear boys, take each of you an arrow, draw your strong bow and let your arrow fly; in whatever court it falls, in that court there will be a wife for you."
The arrow of the oldest Tsarevitch fell on a boyar-house just in front of the terem where women live; the arrow of the second Tsarevitch flew to the red porch of a rich merchant, and on the porch there stood a sweet girl, the merchant's daughter. The youngest, the brave Tsarevitch Ivan, had the ill luck to send his arrow into the midst of a swamp, where it was caught by a croaking frog.
The arrow of the oldest Tsarevitch fell on a nobleman's house just in front of the women's chambers; the arrow of the second Tsarevitch flew to the red porch of a rich merchant, and on the porch there stood a sweet girl, the merchant's daughter. The youngest, the brave Tsarevitch Ivan, had the ill luck to send his arrow into the midst of a swamp, where it was caught by a croaking frog.
Ivan Tsarevitch came to his father: "How can I marry the frog?" complained the son. "Is she my equal? Certainly she is not." "Never mind," replied his father, "you have to marry the frog, for such is evidently your destiny."
Thus the brothers were married: the oldest to a young boyarishnia, a nobleman's child; the second to the merchant's beautiful daughter, and the youngest, Tsarevitch Ivan, to a croaking frog.
Thus the brothers were married: the oldest to a young nobleman's daughter; the second to the merchant's beautiful daughter, and the youngest, Tsarevitch Ivan, to a croaking frog.
Have each of your wives bake a loaf of bread by tomorrow morning.
"C-R-O-A-K! C-R-O-A-K! Dear husband of mine, Tsarevitch Ivan, why are you so sad?" gently asked the frog.
The Tsar, my father, wants you to bake a loaf of white bread by tomorrow.
Then the frog threw off her frogskin and turned into a beautiful, sweet girl, named Vasilissa.
The loaf of bread was so fine that nobody could even describe it, for only in fairyland does one find such marvelous loaves.
Slice the bread very thinly.
The loaf was adorned all about with pretty figures, with towns and fortresses on each side, and within it was white as snow and light as a feather.
The loaf of bread was adorned with ornate tiny squirrels.
Have each of your wives weave a rug by tomorrow.
Again the frog turned into Vasilissa, the wise maiden.
The two elder brothers arrived first with their wives, beautiful, bright, and cheerful, and dressed in rich garments.
Why didst thou not bring thy wife along with thee?

My thirst is quenched.

The heavy oak tables were covered with snow-white linen.
The wives of the two elder brothers watched her and did exactly the same.
When the long, hearty dinner was over, the guests began dancing and singing.
The beautiful Vasilissa came forward, as bright as a star, bowed to her sovereign, bowed to the honorable guests and danced with her husband, the happy Tsarevitch Ivan.
The Tsar, the guests, the servants, even the gray cat sitting in the corner, all were amazed and wondered at the beautiful Vasilissa.
Vasilissa turned into a white swan and flew away through the window.

One day in a wide, flowery field he met a bear, a big Russian bear.
"Do not kill me, kind Tsarevitch," said the bear.
'Poor boy!' said the old poet again, taking him by the hand, and leading him into his room. 'Come to me, and we'll soon make thee warm again, and I will give thee some wine, and some roasted apples for thy supper, my pretty child!'
His eyes shone as bright as stars, and his hair, although dripping with water, curled in beautiful ringlets.
The boy was very pale, and trembled in every limb with cold.
The old poet sat down again beside the stove, and took the little boy in his lap; he wrung the water out of his streaming hair, warmed the child's hands within his own, and gave him mulled wine to drink.
Huh? A mouse sits on my mouse.

There was once a merchant, so rich that he might have paved the whole street where he lived and an alley besides with pieces of silver.
She was so beautiful that the merchant's son could not help kneeling down to kiss her hand.
He talked to her about her eyes, how that they were beautiful dark-blue seas, and that thoughts and feelings floated like mermaids therein; and he spoke of her brow, how that it was a fair snowy mountain, and many other such like things he told her.
Oh, these were charming stories! and thus he wooed the Princess, and she immediately said 'Yes!'

The next morning Tom got up and carried off the goose under his arm. He took no notice at all of the three girls.
Are you not ashamed of yourselves, you bold girls, to run after a young man in that way over the fields? Is that good behaviour?
Then Tom claimed the princess for his wife, and married her; and he was heir to the kingdom, and lived long and happily with his wife.
The princess was of so thoughtful and moody a turn of mind that no one could make her laugh; and the king had made known to all the world, that whoever could make her laugh should have her for his wife.
No one could make the princess laugh.

My parents and teachers all used to tell me when I was younger that "Experience is the best teacher". Of course, during my high school days, my mind was still not that mature, so I took that as is. A little later, a lecturer on some seminar I forgot said that experience isn't necessarily the best teacher, especially if you need to get hurt for it. For him, the experience of others is the best teacher. After all, not only do you get to witness important lessons about the realities of life, you are also spared from getting hurt. That is always nice.
I've told him before that the best solution for him is to seek out actual friends who will console him when he needs emotional support, instead of broadcasting on Fig Hunter, for reasons everyone should know by now. He already has his introvert site! Why should he feel the need to keep talking about his feelings on Fig Hunter when he already knows what will come of it? I understand that he considers Fig Hunter his "home", and the members therein his "guests". However, Pseudo didn't conduct himself as the most gracious host, either. He argued with people and openly called them names. Whether or not he is justified in doing so is irrelevant. What matters is that he doesn't have the time to be doing things like this. Talking back at these people is a complete waste of his time, when he could and should be working on his games or art or studying for university.
Sometimes, the best response is to restrain yourself from responding.
While Pseudo and Co. wage their war on the new site, I've been happily posting here, and reaping a few green orbs for it. During the times that I didn't get green orbs, for example on short comments that I never wanted to get rated anyway, I chose to stay quiet about it not because I want to show that I'm emotionally strong, or being the bigger man or anything. Of course I get upset about it. I like green! Their cyan-and-lower ratings not only bring down my average, but also look ugly on my green-themed posts. Basically, it rustles my jimmies by more than a little bit. Before, as some of you know, I might have started to complain about I don't want my comments to get rated when it's something trivial. Yet I choose not to reply because I know that what I have to say will likely be met with hostility, based on my experience with Fig Hunters.

That job paid well.
Constructive criticism is always welcome.
I'm not a weirdo.
Some people are just weird.

We'll all go to Boston next weekend.
Tom probably thought I was going to Boston with him next weekend.
Tom didn't go to Boston last weekend.
I'll try doing that this weekend.

Why don't you update your website?
I put those photos on my webpage.
We needed this weather.
This is unusual weather.
Do you remember what the girl who was with me last night was wearing?
What do you usually wear?
What should we wear?
Throw down your weapons.
Tom used his umbrella as a weapon.
We don't really have much of a choice, do we?
We're not going to make it in time, are we?
I crossed the road after looking both ways.
Do you feel the same way?
Tom went that way.
I wouldn't go that way.
I recommend you try it this way.
Let's try it this way.
I figured it was easier to do it this way.
I'm afraid we'll get nowhere doing it this way.
My lawyer is on his way.
It always happens the same way.
I also feel the same way.
I'll find a way.
Don't drink this water.
Don't use too much water.

Where's your magic wand?
Have you ever lost your wallet?
Has anyone found a wallet?
I forgot my wallet.
Tom asked if I had found his wallet.
Tom couldn't see over the wall.
I prefer walking.
I like walking.
Are we going to walk?
Can you still walk?
Did you have a nice walk?
We were waiting.
Your friends are waiting.
I wouldn't have waited.
Will we have to wait?
There's nothing we can do except wait.
I know you can't wait.
You know I can't wait.
Tom told Mary to wait.
I'm sure you'll wait.
It wasn't worth the wait.
It's worth the wait.
This is a vowel.
We never voted.

This is my new video.
I love this video.
I really like this video.
I saw the video.
Congratulations on your victory.

Is it really so valuable?
Are you on vacation?
Tom wondered where Mary was going to spend her summer vacation.
I'm officially on vacation.
Tom is on vacation.
They're all on vacation.
It was an unforgettable vacation.
This isn't a vacation.

It doesn't look like Tom believes us.
Nobody understands us.
Tom did it for us.
Tom offered to do that for us.
I'm glad you've done this for us.
The place is too small for us.
I'm sure they'll come back for us.
Tom and Mary were waiting for us.
They were waiting for us.

Tom has come here to help us.
I convinced everyone to help us.
It was Tom who came to help us.
Tom won't be able to help us.

You said you'd help us.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us.

It never occurred to me that Tom wouldn't want to go with us.

Thank you for choosing us.
Thank you for joining us.
Tom left without telling us.
Pray for all of us.
I think it would be good for all of us.
I'm fairly certain Tom doesn't believe us.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't believe us.
They look like us.
I don't think Tom believed us.
Tom walked back upstairs.
Why are you still upset?
Tom is going to be very upset.
I thought I did something to make you upset.
Tom still looks upset.
I know that Tom's upset.
Tom said you were upset.
They're upset.
I was a little upset.
If I did that, Tom would be upset.
Keep us updated.
Would you please shut up?
Why can't you pick me up?
Tom didn't even help Mary up.
You'll understand when you grow up.
This is where I grew up.
This ought to cheer you up.
Here, let me help you up.
I really do wish you'd just shut up.
You need to shut up.
Tom looks like he just got up.
Go ahead and open it up.
Let's get up.
I just made that up.
We'll try to get there early enough to help you set things up.
There is a good chance that gasoline prices will go up.
Tom wondered where Mary had grown up.
I've just woken up.
I'm just warming up.
Maybe you should just give up.
Maybe we should just give up.
I definitely won't give up.
Tom didn't know where he was when he finally woke up.
I woke up.
It's time to wake up.
I can barely stand up.
Tom promised he would be there, but he never showed up.
The numbers don't add up.
The results were unpredictable.
Tom wanted to unpack.
I believe this was unnecessary.
I think it's unnecessary.
I was very unlucky.
Tom was really unlucky.
I was really unlucky.
I'm really unlucky.
They were really unlucky.
This cat is unlucky.
It doesn't sound so unlikely.
Don't be so unkind.
We all sang in unison.
This house is uninhabitable.
Have you really been that unhappy?
I feel very unhappy.
You've made me very unhappy.
Tom still looks unhappy.
Tom was the only one who was unhappy.
Tom wondered what had made Mary so unhappy.
What you're doing is unforgivable.
The result was unexpected.
What you've done is unethical.
I thought Tom was unemployed.
I thought they were unemployed.
I thought you were unemployed.
Tom was glad that Mary understood.
Why can't you understand?
I think you understand.
It's something I can't understand.
Some people will never understand.
I'll help you to understand.
It wasn't difficult to understand.
There's nothing to understand.
It wasn't hard to understand.
It's hard to understand.
Not everyone will understand.
When you see Tom, you'll understand.
Of course, I understand.

Tom still felt uncomfortable.
How much did you inherit from your uncle?
Why did you take my umbrella?
I don't remember where I put my umbrella.
This isn't my umbrella.
Tom couldn't remember where he'd put his umbrella.
I know that isn't Tom's umbrella.
I think Tom has your umbrella.
Here's your umbrella.
I didn't take your umbrella.
You're very ugly.
You aren't ugly.
Did you really see a UFO?
Maybe I wasn't Tom's type.
I'm not your type.
I made two.
I wish I had a twin.
I'm not saying this twice.
Tom hates TV.
You watch too much TV.
Tom was too tired to even just watch TV.
I feel like watching TV.
We could take turns.
I think it's my turn.
Tom didn't know which way to turn.
I'm here on both Mondays and Tuesdays.
It would be worth trying.
Would you like to try?
You'll never know whether or not you can do it until you try.
I'm willing to try.
It's useless to even try.
It might be worth a try.
Do you think Tom told us the truth?
Did Tom tell the truth?

Can Tom be trusted?
Would you open the trunk?
Are you sure that's Tom's trumpet?
I hate that trumpet.
Tom was playing the trumpet.
Was it true?
Why did you sign that confession if it wasn't true?
Do you think it's true?
Is it still true?
Are you sure it's all true?
Say it's not true.
Say that's not true.
There's a good chance that what Tom told you isn't true.
What Tom told you isn't true.
The other things Tom said aren't true.
We hope this is true.
The opposite is true.
Everything that Tom just said was true.
We hope it's all true.
That's all true.
What Tom says isn't quite true.
What Tom says is quite true.
That would be nice if it were true.
It's unlikely to be true.

I was on a tour.
Next year will be tough.
I know it'll be tough.
It'll be tough.

If I were you, I wouldn't eat that.
Wow, you're good at that.
Thank you for telling us that.
Thanks for telling us that.
Tom always does that.
Nobody blames you for that.
I love you for that.
We don't have time for that.
Don't blame me for that.
I can't remember that.
I'll always remember that.
I want to remember that.
We need to remember that.
Oh yeah, I remember that.
We just don't know the answer to that.
It may not come to that.
I sincerely hope it won't come to that.
Tom won't let Mary do that.
I shouldn't have let you do that.
Maybe someone can help you do that.
Tom won't like it if you do that.
Tom said he'd rather not do that.
Tom promised he wouldn't do that.
Tom shouldn't do that.
I'm sure Tom will think we shouldn't do that.
I knew you couldn't do that.
I knew Tom couldn't do that.
It would be best if you didn't do that.
We don't know that Tom didn't do that.
Tom says he'll never do that.
You would never do that.
Don't ever do that.
It was my duty to do that.
I've discovered a good way to do that.
You have until Monday to do that.
You need to show Tom how to do that.
I'm not quite sure how to do that.
I think it would be really good for you to do that.
Nobody will force you to do that.
Tom has warned us not to do that.
There's no good reason not to do that.
I forgot to do that.
Tom said he didn't know anyone who might want to do that.
I knew you wouldn't want to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't want to do that.
Tom didn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom is going to want to do that.
It'll be difficult to do that.
I know several ways to do that.
I didn't remember to do that.
Tom told me that I didn't have permission to do that.
Tom tells me that I don't have permission to do that.
Nobody forced Tom to do that.
I've been trying to do that.
It would be interesting to do that.
I'm sure you're not going to do that.
I don't think Tom is going to do that.
We're unwilling to do that.
I'm very glad I didn't have to do that.
I refuse to do that.
I don't have time to do that.
I don't think I can find the time to do that.
I don't think Tom will ever be able to do that.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
I never would've imagined Tom would be able to do that.
I wouldn't like to do that.
I intend to do that.
They're paid to do that.
I know that wasn't how I was supposed to do that.
I didn't know that I was supposed to do that.
I don't think you need to do that.
I had to do that.
I'm not sure I can do that.
I don't think Tom will do that.
I can still do that.
I just hope no one saw me do that.
I never thought Tom would do that.
It would be interesting to see if we could do that.
It would be nice if we could do that.
I've always wanted to see if I could do that.
If I were you, I'd do that.
I'll refrain from commenting on that.
I've never forgotten that.
I'd forgotten that.
I've never seen that.
We'll do more than that.
I believe Tom did mean that.
I don't think I could tell Tom that.
I really wish you hadn't told Tom that.
We're not going to risk that.
I'll help you with that.
I'm not saying that.
I can't remember ever doing that.
Tom couldn't see himself ever doing that.
I don't plan on doing that.
I've never thought of doing that.
I had trouble doing that.
Tom probably thought I wouldn't like doing that.
I won't be doing that.
I regretted doing that.
I wonder if Tom has already thought of that.
You might want to make a note of that.
Let me take care of that.
Don't be afraid of that.
I guess I could use that.
I can't promise that.
I'll see Tom before that.
I really do wish you hadn't done that.
I realized later that I shouldn't have done that.
There was a time when I would've done that.
Tom sent me that.
Tom was the first to tell me that.
Tom was the first person to tell me that.
Thanks for telling me that.
It was Tom who gave me that.
I was just like that.
I was pretty certain that Tom wouldn't like that.
I've never had problems like that.
I try not to worry about things like that.
I didn't know that they did things like that.
I didn't expect you to like that.
I used to like that.
We're not all like that.
I won't do anything like that.
I wouldn't do anything like that.
Tom did say something like that.
I'd love something like that.
Tom was sure you'd like that.
Maybe we can change that.
Nothing will change that.
I hadn't heard that.
I still can't understand that.
Tom wondered if Mary would understand that.
I already sold that.
It was Tom who did that.
Apparently, Tom is the one who did that.
I don't understand why Tom did that.
I knew you wouldn't like the way Tom did that.
Tom should've asked me before he did that.
Tom laughed when Mary said that.
You would've been wrong if you'd said that.
Tom wondered if there were still people who believed that.
Maybe I just imagined that.
I've never liked that.
I really needed that.
I never noticed that.
Beginning next week, we'll be using a new textbook.
I'll send you a text.
It was a tough test.
Tom was glad that Mary was able to pass the test.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to pass the test.
I hate terrorism.
It's not so terrible.
Where would you like to pitch the tent?
Tom was tense.
Which would you rather do, go swimming or play tennis?
Do you want to play tennis?
Let's play tennis.
Tom probably thought I could play tennis.
I always enjoy playing tennis.
I couldn't resist the temptation.
I've got a lot to tell.
I feel like watching television.
I work in telecommunications.
I just brushed my teeth.
Now go brush your teeth.

This is an important task.
It was an impossible task.
Make sure you don't forget to fill up the tank.
Your daughter's tall.
Tom waited till the door was closed before he started talking.
Tom and I sat down to talk.
Tom has a lot of talent.
Where was this photo taken?
Which would you take?
I didn't realize how much time this was going to take.
Please don't move these tables.
Tom helped his mother set the table.
There are some apples on the table.

Tom wondered why Mary didn't enjoy swimming.
I want to become better at swimming.
I want to become a better swimmer.

I didn't realize you didn't know how to swim.
Tom is teaching me how to swim.
Tom doesn't want to swim.
I don't think Tom can swim.

There are too many things here to fit into this suitcase.
Everything I own is in this suitcase.
Tom didn't know where to put Mary's suitcase.
Is this suitable?
Do you like my new suit?
I never thought Tom would commit suicide.
It seems unlikely that Tom committed suicide.
Give me some suggestions.

This isn't a believable story.
That's not the end of the story.
Tom told me a strange story.
Tell me your life story.

You can't keep a secret.
It'll take a few seconds.
Could you come here for a second?

Your story wasn't very scary.
It's not that scary.
What color is Mary's scarf?
When I saw that Tom had a gun, I got scared.
I'm beginning to get scared.
They're looking for a scapegoat.
I got scammed.
That's what the law says.
That's what Tom always says.
Do what your mother says.
You shouldn't always believe what Tom says.
I want to see what the message says.

What else is there to say?
What would you like me to say?
What else could Tom say?
What exactly did Tom say?
What did the police say?
So, what did your dad say?
We'd better do what they say.
I agree with what you say.

There's something I want to say.
I don't believe that's what you meant to say.
I don't believe that's what I meant to say.
Tom didn't know just what to say.
Tom wondered what Mary wanted him to say.

At least they listened to what we had to say.
Tom wondered what he should say.

Do I have to answer that question?
Now what's your question?
Why don't you just answer the question?

I like the same things you do.
Your brother looks a lot more like your father than you do.
It would be best if you did everything Tom asks you to do.
That was a stupid thing for you to do.
I'll tell you exactly what I need you to do.
Tom was able to accomplish everything he'd set out to do.
Do what you want to do.
Tom said he had to do some things he didn't want to do.
You haven't asked me what I want to do.
You haven't even asked me what I want to do.
It looks like you don't really know what to do.
It seems like you don't know what to do.
Tom will show you what to do.
Tom didn't know just what to do.
It looks like you've finally decided what to do.
I can't believe this is what Tom really wants us to do.
Let's do what Tom wants us to do.
We had no choice. We had to do what they told us to do.
We had to do what they told us to do.
I guess we should do what Tom asked us to do.
Tom won't let Mary do anything she wants to do.
I have a few things to do.
We have other things to do.
There's nothing better to do.
That was a stupid thing for Tom to do.
Tom didn't feel he could do what Mary was asking him to do.
Tom knew that he wouldn't be able to do what Mary wanted him to do.
Tom readily promised to do what we asked him to do.
Tom did neither of the two things I asked him to do.
Tom wondered what Mary was planning to do.
Tom didn't mention what he was planning to do.
We don't have anything to do.
Tom says he has nothing to do.
It won't be an easy thing to do.
It's the smart thing to do.
Telling me was the right thing to do.
I think it's the right thing to do.
This is what I have to do.
I still can't remember what Tom told me to do.
I've already done everything you've asked me to do.
Tom didn't do anything that he wasn't supposed to do.
Tom couldn't help noticing that there were many people doing things they weren't supposed to do.
Tom couldn't remember what he was supposed to do.
Tom didn't understand what he was supposed to do.
I know that wasn't what I was supposed to do.
Make sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
I still can't remember what I'm supposed to do.
Just do what you're supposed to do.
Tom didn't see how he could manage to do everything he'd been asked to do.
There's a lot that we still need to do.
I've been thinking about what we need to do.
I have something else I need to do.
Tom tried to tell Mary what she needed to do.
Tom didn't say what else he had to do.
I only did what I had to do.
Tom had an important job to do.
It's all you really can do.
You just have to wait. There's nothing else you can do.
It's the least we can do.
I don't see what we can do.
Look what I can do.
For now, that's the only thing I can do.
Tell me what you'll do.
Yeah, that's what I'll do.
That'll be the next thing we do.
Look what you made me do.
Tom is sure to know what we should do.
Tom will know what we should do.
I have no idea what I should do.
Tom didn't know what he'd do.
Yeah, that's what I'd do.
Tom spends less time studying French than I do.
Tom wondered if Mary knew John and Alice were planning on getting divorced.
Tom still doesn't know that Mary and I are divorced.
Tom doesn't know it yet, but Mary plans to ask him for a divorce.
I can't jump over that ditch.
Tom just told me something very disturbing.
Sorry, I was distracted.
I heard a siren in the distance.
I was quite dissatisfied.
Tom is washing the dishes.
I washed the dishes.
Don't you think that's a bit disgusting?
That's really disgusting.
It's disgusting.
It's a bad disease.
What are you discussing?
Is there anything you want to discuss?
I don't know what else there is to discuss.
We have other things to discuss.
We have other things we need to discuss.
Let's not get discouraged.
Tom is discouraged.
I'm not a disbeliever.
I've had too many disappointments.
It was a huge disappointment.
I was very disappointed.
Hopefully, no one will be disappointed.
You have to disappear.
Who became the new director?
Tom didn't answer the question directly.
All I want is directions.
Tom looked in the wrong direction.
Didn't you see Tom at dinner?
Do you want to stay for dinner?
Is it almost time for dinner?
Why aren't you cooking dinner?
Thank you for the delicious dinner.
We're ready for dinner.
It's almost time for dinner.
You're invited to dinner.
Tom made dinner.
I've made dinner.
I know you'll enjoy the food at Chuck's Diner.
The exam was very difficult.
Getting started is always difficult.
The exam was difficult.
It's all so difficult.
I know it'll be difficult.
That's different.
With Tom, it would've been different.
If Tom had been there, it would've been different.
Wow, you look different.
We were expecting something different.
Try eating something different.
Has someone died?
It was here that Tom died.
Without you, I would've died.
Aren't you afraid to die?
Do you think Tom will die?
You'll remember that until you die.
Love doesn't die.
Do you know what I just did?
Do you really know what Tom did?
Did you hear what Tom did?
Tom couldn't remember, but Mary did.
Tom didn't choose the same thing Mary did.
Tom didn't care who helped him, as long as somebody did.
Think about what you did.
Look what you did.
I'm awfully glad you showed up when you did.
Tom couldn't have said it any better than you did.
Tom would've done the same thing you did.
I recently learned about what Tom did.
It takes great courage to do what Tom did.
I saw what your dog did.
Tom promised not to tell anyone about what we did.
Maybe we should blame Tom for what we did.
We did the same thing as everybody else did.
Tom wondered what had made Mary do what she did.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as I thought he did.
Tom didn't say what he did.
I didn't do what you think I did.
I want this dictionary.
Tom shouldn't have told Mary where he hid the diamonds.
Do you have diabetes?
Could you give us more details?
Tom wouldn't give me any details.
Tom wanted to hear every detail.
I don't have enough space in my room for that desk.
Everyone gets what they deserve.
It's what we deserve.
Tom's story was very depressing.
This is depressing.
I'm very depressed.
When it rains, I get depressed.

This peanut butter is delicious.
It sounds delicious.
They're delicious.
This is really delicate.
The train has been delayed.
It looks like a deer.
Is the well deep?

Why do I have to be the one who makes this decision?
We'll make the right decision.
I hope we've made the right decision.
I made the right decision.
I think it's a fair decision.
I've just made a decision.
Have you finally decided?
It looks like you've finally decided.
Why do I have to decide?
I don't have any debt.

Tom was half beaten to death.
I hope we don't starve to death.

I'm not sure, but perhaps Tom is already dead.
I'm glad Tom isn't dead.
Tom and Mary are both dead.
Both my parents are dead.
Apparently, they're dead.
Everyone thinks you're dead.
You should pretend to be dead.

Tom remained in Boston for a few days.
I'm happy these days.
You'll understand why one of these days.
Wait a few more days.
Tom postponed his departure for three days.
I'll be gone for three days.
How did you spend your day?
Did you sleep all day?
Did you have a good day?
You should try to learn something new every day.

There's nothing better than a good cup of coffee to start off the day.
Today wasn't a good day.
What a lousy day!
Is this your daughter?
What happened to your daughter?
You're too young to be dating.
Did Tom ask you on a date?
This is the place where your mother and I had our first date.
Have a good time on your date.
I don't trust this data.
Can cats really see in the dark?
Some women are very dangerous.
Tonight, let's all go dancing.
